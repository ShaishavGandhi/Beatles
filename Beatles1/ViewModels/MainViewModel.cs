Originally titled 'Seventeen', the song was apparently conceived by McCartney while driving home from a Beatles' concert in Southport, Lancashire and later completed at his Forthlin Road home with Lennon. McCartney later described in  Beat Instrumental  how he went about the song's composition: 'Here’s one example of a bit I pinched from someone: I used the bass riff from 'Talkin’ About You' by Chuck Berry in 'I Saw Her Standing There'. I played exactly the same notes as he did and it fitted our number perfectly. Even now, when I tell people, I find few of them believe me; therefore, I maintain that a bass riff hasn’t got to be original'. The lyrics were written on a Liverpool Institute exercise book.  Remember , a book by McCartney's brother Mike McCartney, includes a photograph of Lennon and McCartney writing the song while strumming guitars and reading the exercise book. It was typical of how Lennon and McCartney would work in partnership, as McCartney later commented: 'I had 'She was just seventeen,' and then 'never been a beauty queen'. When I showed it to John, he screamed with laughter, and said 'You're joking about that line, aren't you? 'It was one of the first times he ever went 'What?

Her artist and repertoire manager, Norrie Paramor, was looking for new material for a country and western album she planned to record in Nashville, Tennessee and suggested that The Beatles compose a song especially for her.  Misery  was started backstage before The Beatles' performance at the King's Hall, Stoke-on-Trent, on 26 January 1963, and later completed at Paul McCartney's Forthlin Road home. At the time, McCartney commented: 'We've called it 'Misery', but it isn't as slow as it sounds, it moves along at quite a pace, and we think Helen will make a pretty good job of it.' But Paramor considered it unsuitable, and so British singer and entertainer Kenny Lynch, who was on the same tour, recorded it instead, thus becoming the first artist to cover a Lennon–McCartney composition, although he failed to enter the charts with it. In 1973, Lynch appeared in the cover photograph for McCartney's album, Band on the Run.\n\nWhen The Beatles needed original material for their Please Please Me LP they recorded it themselves, giving its treatment, according to writer Ian MacDonald, 'a droll portrait of adolescent self-pity'. It was credited to McCartney and Lennon in that order, as were all other Lennon & McCartney originals on the Please Please Me album. The songwriting credit was changed to what would become the more familiar  Lennon–McCartney  for their second album, With The Beatles. \n\n",Personnel=" John Lennon – rhythm guitar, lead vocal\nPaul McCartney – bass guitar, lead vocal\nGeorge Harrison – lead guitar\nRingo Starr – drums\n George Martin - piano ", Image1 = "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a4/PleasePleaseMe.jpg", AudioSrc = "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/71957094/02%20-%20Misery.mp3" });

Part of the problem was that the group were committed to begin what was to be their final Hamburg season just as 'Love Me Do' entered the British charts, and so were unable to actively promote it on their home soil. Nonetheless, their producer, George Martin, felt it was a promising start and decided to go ahead with a second single. 'Please Please Me' has a diverse history. George Martin has stated that the original version of this song was 'rather dreary', was too slow and consequently had little prospect of being the big hit the band were looking for. Lennon first conceived Please Please Me as a bluesy, slow tempo song. Lennon recalled: 'I remember the day I wrote it, I heard Roy Orbison doing 'Only the Lonely', or something. And I was also always intrigued by the words to a Bing Crosby song that went, 'Please lend a little ear to my pleas'. The double use of the word 'please'.

John Lennon wrote the middle eight. Their practice at the time was to scribble songs in a school notebook, dreaming of stardom, always writing 'Another Lennon-McCartney Original' at the top of the page. Love Me Do is intrinsically a song based around two simple chords: G7 and C, before moving to D for its middle eight. It first profiles Lennon playing a bluesy dry 'dockside harmonica' riff, then features Lennon and McCartney on joint lead vocals, including Everly Brothers style harmonising during the beseeching 'please' before McCartney sings the unaccompanied vocal line on the song's title phrase. Lennon had previously sung the title sections, but this change in arrangement was made in the studio under the direction of producer George Martin when he realised that the harmonica part encroached on the vocal (Lennon needed to begin playing the harmonica again on the same beat as the 'do' of 'love me do' although, according to Ian MacDonald, for the earlier 6 June audition the harmonica was overdubbed, allowing Lennon to sing the title phrase unhindered). This is illustrative of the time constraints on this particular session - their first recording session proper; as for instance, when a similar situation later occurred on the 'Please Please Me' single session, the harmonica was superimposed afterwards using tape-to-tape overdubbing. Described by MacDonald as 'standing out like a bare brick wall in a suburban sitting-room', 'Love Me Do' with its stark 'blunt working class northerness' rang 'the first faint chime of a revolutionary bell' compared to the standard tin pan alley productions occupying the charts at the time. On 4 September 1962, Brian Epstein paid for the Beatles, along with their new drummer, Ringo Starr, to fly down from Liverpool to London. After first checking into their Chelsea hotel, they arrived at EMI Studios early in the afternoon where they set up their equipment in Studio 3 and began rehearsing six songs including: 'Please Please Me', 'Love Me Do' and a song originally composed for Adam Faith by Mitch Murray called 'How Do You Do It?' which George Martin 'was insisting, in the apparent absence of any stronger original material, would be the group's first single'. Lennon and McCartney had yet to impress Martin with their songwriting ability, and the Beatles had been signed as recording artists on the basis of their charismatic appeal: 'It wasn't a question of what they could do [as] they hadn't written anything great at that time.' 'But what impressed me most was their personalities. Sparks flew off them when you talked to them'. During the course of an evening session that then followed (7:00 pm to 10:00 pm in Studio 2) they recorded 'How Do You Do It' and 'Love Me Do'. An attempt at 'Please Please Me' was made, but at this stage it was quite different to its eventual treatment and it was dropped by Martin. This was a disappointment for the group as they had hoped it would be the B-side to 'Love Me Do'.The Beatles were keen to record their own material, something which was almost unheard of at that time, and it is generally accepted that it is to George Martin's credit that they were allowed to float their own ideas in the first instance. But Martin insisted that unless they could write something as commercial as 'How Do You Do It?' then the Tin Pan Alley practice of having the group record songs by professional songwriters (which was standard procedure then, and is still common today) would be followed. MacDonald points out, however: 'It's almost certainly true that there was no other producer on either side of the Atlantic then capable of handling the Beatles without damaging them - let alone of cultivating and catering to them with the gracious, open-minded adeptness for which George Martin is universally respected in the British pop industry.' Martin rejects however the view that he was the 'genius' behind the group: 'I was purely an interpreter. The genius was theirs: no doubt about that.'",Personnel = "John Lennon – lead vocal, harmonica\nPaul McCartney – lead vocal, bass guitar\nGeorge Harrison – acoustic guitar\nRingo Starr – drums", Image1 = "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a4/PleasePleaseMe.jpg" ,AudioSrc = "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/71957094/08%20-%20Love%20Me%20Do.mp3" });

McCartney owned the album of the soundtrack at the time of writing 'There's a Place' and acknowledges its influence. The 'place' in question was 'the mind', making its subject matter slightly more cerebral than Britain's kissing and cuddling songs and America's surf music from that period.

'Twist and Shout', with John Lennon on lead vocals, was the last song recorded; producer George Martin knew Lennon's voice would suffer from the performance, so he left it until last, with only 15 minutes of scheduled recording time remaining. Lennon was suffering from a cold, and was drinking milk and sucking on cough drops to soothe his throat. His coughing is audible on the album, as is the cold's effect on his voice. Even so, he produced a memorable vocal performance: a raucous, dynamic rocker. He later said his voice was not the same for a long time afterward, and that 'every time [he] swallowed, it felt like sandpaper'. It is regarded as one of the finest examples of British rock and roll for its vocal performance. The song was used as a rousing closing number on Sunday Night at the London Palladium in October 1963 and at The Royal Variety Show in November 1963, the former signalling the start of 'Beatlemania'.

Typical also of this phase of Beatles' song writing is the melodramatic ending (similar to \"She Loves You\", which had just been recorded and was about to be released) where the music stops, allowing Lennon a brief solo vocal improvisation before the song finishes on a major seventh chord (\"She Loves You\" ends on a major sixth). There is an unusual middle eight—for what is, essentially, a rock and roll song—that uses chromatically descending chords.\nJohn Lennon, in his last interview, told Playboy magazine that the song was the beginning of a wider audience for Beatles' music than the youthful throngs that had fervently followed them from their Liverpool clubbing days. \"It was only after a critic for the {London} Times said we put 'Aeolian cadences' in 'It Won't Be Long' that the middle classes started listening to us. ... To this day, I have no idea what \"Aeolian cadences\" are.

Lennon said that it was written specifically for the American market; the idea of calling a girl on the telephone was unthinkable to a British youth in the early 1960s. For instance, Lennon said in an interview regarding \"No Reply\": \"I had the image of walking down the street and seeing her silhouetted in the window and not answering the 'phone, although I have never called a girl on the 'phone in my life! Because 'phones weren't part of the English child's life.\"\nAlthough music journalist Steve Turner claims the song was written in 1961, MacDonald said the song was never in the Beatles' live repertoire, and that explains why 8 of the 14 takes were incomplete: the band was unfamiliar with the song.",Personnel = "John Lennon – lead vocal, rhythm guitar\nPaul McCartney – backing vocal, bass\nGeorge Harrison – backing vocal, lead guitar\nRingo Starr – drums", Image1 = " http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0a/Withthebeatlescover.jpg/220px-Withthebeatlescover.jpg",AudioSrc = "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/71957094/02%20-%20All%20I%C2%B4ve%20Got%20To%20Do.mp3" });

I've hardly ever done it since either.\" The lyrics follow the \"letter song\" model as used on \"P.S. I Love You\", the B-side of their first single. After arriving at the location of the gig, he wrote the music on a piano backstage.\nMcCartney originally envisioned it as a country & western song, and George Harrison added a Nashville-style guitar solo.

Ian MacDonald said, \"The innocence of early Sixties British pop is perfectly distilled in the eloquent simplicity of this number\" and described the song as helping McCartney be seen as more of an equal to Lennon.

Both were recorded by The Beatles but neither was released officially by the band until 1995's Anthology 1 compilation.

They sound like exotic birds.\" The actual meaning of the term \"Aeolian cadence\" is when a major key song resolves on the VI chord, which is the tonic chord of the relative minor key. The term derives from the fact that the Aeolian mode is rooted on the sixth step of the major scale.\nDominic Pedler considers the 'Aeolian cadence\" moment to occur at the end of this line: (Am) \"You hurt me then. You're back again. No/(Bm) no no/(D7) not a second time\"/(Em). Pedler writes: \"We are expecting the D7 chord, the dominant in the key of G, to return to the G major tonic\" however in replacing it with an Em chord supporting an isolated E note on \"time\" we have an interrupted cadence or dominant to relative sub-minor (V7 to vi) shift. The major key of the song is G, but it appears to resolve on the Em (VI) chord. As Allan Moore puts it \"Mann would argue that it is not the same thing as a \"V-vi\" Interrupted or Deceptive cadence because- at that precise point in the song- the role of the E minor as a \"vi\" is being questioned and is veering towards tonic status.\"\nPedler notes that another interesting moment in the song is that George Martin's piano part alternates not between G and E minor, but G and E major, the presence of the piano's extra G# (the major 3rd of the E chord) creating a \"grating, tense colouring\" in comparison to a G natural of the guitar's Em chord. Pedler's discussion with musical experts about the comparison between this Beatles song and Mahler's \"Song of the Earth\" revealed that none found anything relevant, except perhaps that Mahler's Farewell movement involves various shades of a C major chord and ends after a flute B-A drop (the A chord being a VI in the chord of C) with the \"final sonority\" of a C6 (where the C, E and G notes are from the trombones and lower strings and the A from oboe and flute)",Personnel = "John Lennon – double-tracked vocal, acoustic guitar\n Paul McCartney – bass\n George Harrison – acoustic guitar\nRingo Starr – drums\n George Martin – producer, piano", Image1 = " http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0a/Withthebeatlescover.jpg/220px-Withthebeatlescover.jpg" ,AudioSrc = "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/71957094/13%20-%20Not%20A%20Second%20Time.mp3" });

The second half of each verse is harmonized with 'oohs', and the ostinato figure begins before the last line finishes. The overlapping of the ostinato figure contributes to the slightly disordered feel of the song.\nThe lyrics are generally believed to concern McCartney's relationship with Jane Asher. Between McCartney and Lennon, McCartney had typically been the more optimistic of the two when it came to songwriting.

Among these was a version of Berry's tune that eventually became as well known as the original. The lead vocal in The Beatles' version was performed by John Lennon. In contrast to Berry's even-toned rendition, Lennon sang it as loudly and dynamically as his voice would permit. In the United States, it was released on the LP, Beatles '65. The song was part of the set list for the group's final tour in 1966 - the performance from their June 30 show at the Nippon Budokan was included in 1996's Anthology 2 - and was also performed during the Get Back/Let It Be Sessions in January 1969.",Personnel = "John Lennon – vocals, rhythm guitar\nPaul McCartney – bass\nGeorge Harrison – electric guitar\nRingo Starr – drums\nGeorge Martin – piano", Image1 = " http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/40/Beatlesforsale.jpg/220px-Beatlesforsale.jpg" ,AudioSrc = "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/71957094/04%20-%20Rock%20And%20Roll%20Music.mp3" });

Lennon and McCartney tried several ideas for the intro and outro of the song. The first take featured a simple acoustic guitar introduction. The second take introduced an 'oo'-ing vocal that was experimented with until the sixth take, when it was abandoned in favour of the final guitar intro. The final outro (along with unused intro takes) was recorded separately on 18 October.

Between McCartney and Lennon, McCartney had typically been the more optimistic of the two when it came to songwriting.

With an up-tempo swing-beat that the writer favoured (\"Can't Buy Me Love\", \"She's a Woman\") the song opens with a short refrain, powered by block vocal harmonies, that segues straight into the verse, which is constructed on the blues-mode chord changes the group currently favoured. The bridge theme makes a sudden key change up a minor third from A to C (a harmonic strategy also used on the record's next track \"You're Going to Lose That Girl\") and features more close three-part harmonies as the aggressively sung verse's apparent threat to a jealous girl turns into a sweet tribute to the \"other\" girl who \"will always be my friend\".The Beatles recorded the song on 15 February 1965, having also worked on \"Ticket to Ride\" and \"I Need You\". The backing track was quickly recorded in a single take. George Harrison added a guitar \"flourish\" at the end which was omitted from the final mix: McCartney added lead guitar the next day.

Four-track recording allowed the group to refine songs' arrangements in the studio and McCartney often had clear ideas about the guitar lines he wanted.

In this case the bridge emerges a measure early, diving a semitone down to meet the verse.

Lennon said this double-time section (with the lyric \"My baby don't care\") was one of his \"favourite bits\" in the song.\"Ticket to Ride\" was released as a single on 9 April 1965 in the United Kingdom and 19 April in the United States with \"Yes It Is\" as its B-side, topping the Hot 100 for a week in the US and the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in the UK.

Not awfully memorable\"—\"Tell Me What You See\" shows the musical growth of the Beatles since Please Please Me, and foreshadows their further exploration on Rubber Soul and Revolver.

The instrument is featured on two other tracks on Help!: \"You Like Me Too Much\" and \"The Night Before\", both recorded the day before \"Tell Me What You See.\" Starr's drumming on the track is augmented with a trio of percussion instruments; a güiro, a tambourine, and a pair of claves. Although the Beatles had been using additional percussion instruments to flesh out their sound as early as \"Don't Bother Me\" in 1963, they had rarely been featured this prominently in the mix.\nEvident in the song's structure and instrumentation is the group's then growing folk influence, with lyrics more mature and reflective than was standard in their earlier output. Nevertheless, the line \"trying to get to you\" (the title of an early Elvis Presley song recorded for Sun Records which served as inspiration for McCartney & Harrison's first composition, \"In Spite of All the Danger\") is a clear reminder of both songwriters' love for early rock and roll.

Upon waking, he hurried to a piano and played the tune to avoid forgetting it.\nMcCartney's initial concern was that he had subconsciously plagiarised someone else's work (known as cryptomnesia).

As Lennon and McCartney were known to do at the time, a substitute working lyric, titled \"Scrambled Eggs\" (the working opening verse was \"Scrambled Eggs/Oh, my baby how I love your legs\"), was used for the song until something more suitable was written. In his biography, Paul McCartney: Many Years from Now, McCartney recalled: \"So first of all I checked this melody out, and people said to me, 'No, it's lovely, and I'm sure it's all yours.' It took me a little while to allow myself to claim it, but then like a prospector I finally staked my claim; stuck a little sign on it and said, 'Okay, it's mine!' It had no words. I used to call it 'Scrambled Eggs'.\"\nDuring the shooting of Help!, a piano was placed on one of the stages where filming was being conducted and McCartney would take advantage of this opportunity to tinker with the song. Richard Lester, the director, was eventually greatly annoyed by this and lost his temper, telling McCartney to finish writing the song or he would have the piano removed. The patience of the other Beatles was also tested by McCartney's work in progress, George Harrison summing this up when he said: \"Blimey, he's always talking about that song. You'd think he was Beethoven or somebody!\"\nMcCartney originally claimed he had written \"Yesterday\" during the Beatles' tour of France in 1964; however, the song was not released until the summer of 1965. During the intervening time, the Beatles released two albums, A Hard Day's Night and Beatles for Sale, both of which could have included \"Yesterday\". Although McCartney has never elaborated his claims, a delay may have been due to a disagreement between McCartney and George Martin regarding the song's arrangement, or the opinion of the other Beatles who felt it did not suit their image.\n Lenon said \"The song was around for months and months before we finally completed it. Every time we got together to write songs for a recording session, this one would come up. We almost had it finished. Paul wrote nearly all of it, but we just couldn't find the right title. We called it 'Scrambled Eggs' and it became a joke between us. We made up our minds that only a one-word title would suit, we just couldn't find the right one. Then one morning Paul woke up and the song and the title were both there, completed.

Norwegian wood. It was pine, really, cheap pine. But it's not as good a title, \"Cheap Pine\", baby.

So she makes him sleep in the bath and then finally in the last verse I had this idea to set the Norwegian wood on fire as revenge, so we did it very tongue in cheek. She led him on, then said, \"You'd better sleep in the bath.\" In our world the guy had to have some sort of revenge ... so it meant I burned the place down ....\"\nHarrison—who would later be strongly influenced by Indian culture and become a practitioner of transcendental meditation—decided on using a sitar when The Beatles recorded the song on 12 and 21 October 1965. He later said: \"During the filming of Help! there were some Indian musicians in a restaurant scene and I kind of messed around with a sitar then. But during that year, towards the end of the year anyway, I kept hearing the name of Ravi Shankar. [...] So I went out and bought a record and that was it. It felt very familiar to me to listen to that music. It was around that time I bought a sitar. I just bought a cheap sitar in a shop called India Craft, in London. It was lying around. I hadn't really figured out what to do with it. When we were working on Norwegian Wood it just needed something, and it was quite spontaneous, from what I remember. I just picked up my sitar, found the notes and just played it. We miked it up and put it on and it just seemed to hit the spot.\"\nThe song is described by writer Mark Lewisohn as \"pure Lennon genius ... one of the most original pop music songs recorded to date\",and by music critic Richie Unterberger as \"undoubtedly the Beatles' greatest lyrical triumph during their folk-rock phase\".

I never learned it. But based on Atkins' \"Trambone\", I wanted to write something with a melody and a bass line in it, so I did. I just had it as an instrumental in C.\"\nThe words and style of \"Michelle\" have their origins in the popularity of French Left Bank culture during McCartney's Liverpool days. McCartney had gone to a party of art students where a student with a goatee and a striped T-shirt was singing a French song. He soon wrote a farcical imitation to entertain his friends that involved French-sounding groaning instead of real words. The song remained a party piece until 1965, when John Lennon suggested he rework it into a proper song for inclusion on Rubber Soul. \"we'd tag along to these parties, and it was at the time of people like Juliette Greco, the French bohemian thing... So I used to pretend to be French, and I had this song that turned out later to be 'Michelle'. It was just an instrumental, but years later John said: 'You remember that thing you wrote about the French?' I said: 'Yeah.' He said: 'That wasn't a bad song, that. You should do that, y'know.' \"\nMcCartney decided to remain with the French feel of his song and asked Jan Vaughan, a French teacher and the wife of his old friend Ivan Vaughan, to come up with a French name and a phrase that rhymed with it. \"It was because I'd always thought that the song sounded French that I stuck with it. I can't speak French properly so that's why I needed help in sorting out the actual words\", McCartney said.\nVaughan came up with \"Michelle, ma belle\", and a few days later McCartney asked for a translation of \"these are words that go together well\" — sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble. When McCartney played the song for Lennon, Lennon suggested the \"I love you\" bridge.

He explained: \"I was just talking about Christianity in that - a thing like you have to be tortured to attain heaven. [...] - be tortured and then it'll be alright, which seems to be a bit true but not in their concept of it. But I didn't believe in that, that you have to be tortured to attain anything, it just so happens that you were.\"\nLennon said that the fantasy girl in the song's lyric was an archetype he had been searching for his entire life (\"There is no such thing as the girl — she was a dream\") and finally found in Yoko Ono. In an interview for Rolling Stone magazine on 5 December 1980, Lennon said his 1980 song \"Woman\":\n\"Reminds me of a Beatles track, but I wasn't trying to make it sound like that.

The original version of the lyrics was based on a bus route he used to take in Liverpool, naming various sites seen along the way, including Penny Lane and Strawberry Field. Those original lyrics are on display at The British Museum.\nHowever, Lennon found it to be \"ridiculous\", calling it \"the most boring sort of 'What I Did On My Holidays Bus Trip' song\"; he reworked the words, replacing the specific memories with a generalised meditation on his past. \"Very few lines\" of the original version remained in the finished song. According to Lennon's friend and biographer Peter Shotton, the lines \"Some [friends] are dead and some are living/In my life I've loved them all\" referred to Stuart Sutcliffe (who died in 1962) and to Shotton\nRegarding authorship of the melody, Lennon's and McCartney's recollections differ.

In a 1984 interview with Playboy magazine, Paul McCartney explained: \"George wrote that and I played guitar on it. He wrote it in anger at finding out what the taxman did. He had never known before then what he'll do with your money.\"\nIn 1980, Lennon recalled in an interview with Playboy magazine, \"I remember the day he [Harrison] called to ask for help on 'Taxman', one of his first songs.

The name that came to him, though, was not Eleanor Rigby but Miss Daisy Hawkins. Donovan reported that he heard McCartney play it to him before it was finished with completely different lyrics. In 1966, McCartney recalled how he got the idea for his song:\n\nI was sitting at the piano when I thought of it. The first few bars just came to me, and I got this name in my head... 'Daisy Hawkins picks up the rice in the church'. I don't know why. I couldn't think of much more so I put it away for a day. Then the name Father McCartney came to me, and all the lonely people. But I thought that people would think it was supposed to be about my Dad sitting knitting his socks. Dad's a happy lad. So I went through the telephone book and I got the name 'McKenzie'\n\nMcCartney said he came up with the name \"Eleanor\" from actress Eleanor Bron, who had starred with the Beatles in the film Help!. \"Rigby\" came from the name of a store in Bristol, \"Rigby & Evens Ltd, Wine & Spirit Shippers\", that he noticed while seeing his girlfriend of the time, Jane Asher, act in The Happiest Days of Your Life. He recalled in 1984, \"I just liked the name. I was looking for a name that sounded natural. 'Eleanor Rigby' sounded natural.\" However, it has been pointed out that the graveyard of St Peter's Church in Liverpool, where John Lennon and Paul McCartney first met on the Woolton Village garden fete in the afternoon of 6 July 1957, contains the gravestone of an individual called Eleanor Rigby. Paul McCartney has conceded he may have been subconsciously influenced by the name on the gravestone. Bizarrely, the real Eleanor Rigby lived a lonely life similar to that of the person in the song.\nMcCartney wrote the first verse by himself, and the Beatles finished the song in the music room of John Lennon's home at Kenwood. John Lennon, George Harrison, Ringo Starr, and their friend Pete Shotton all listened to McCartney play his song through and contributed ideas. Starr contributed the line \"writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear \" and suggested making \"Father McCartney\" darn his socks, which McCartney liked. Shotton then suggested that McCartney change the name of the priest, in case listeners mistook the fictional character in the song for McCartney's own father\n\"Eleanor Rigby\" is also important in the Beatles' evolution from a pop, live-performance band to a more experimental, studio-oriented band, though the track contains little studio trickery. In a 1967 interview Pete Townshend of The Who commented \"I think 'Eleanor Rigby' was a very important musical move forward. It certainly inspired me to write and listen to things in that vein.\"\nThough \"Eleanor Rigby\" was not the first pop song to deal with death and loneliness, according to Ian MacDonald it \"came as quite a shock to pop listeners in 1966.\" It took a bleak message of depression and desolation, written by a famous pop band, with a sombre, almost funeral-like backing, to the number one spot of the pop charts.

Five further takes of the song were recorded but none were used. Take 11 was chosen as the master and two days later Lennon added his lead vocals. On 5 May, George Harrison wrote and recorded the double guitar part. The next day the recording was completed by Lennon, McCartney and Harrison's backing vocals.\nThe song features the then-unique sound of a reversed guitar duet played by Harrison in a five-hour late-night recording session with producer George Martin. Harrison perfected the part with the tape running backwards so that, when reversed, it would fit the dreamlike mood. One guitar was recorded with fuzz effects, the other without. Engineer Geoff Emerick described the meticulous process as \"an interminable day,\" lasting nine hours. \"I can still picture George hunched over his guitar for hours on end,\" Emerick wrote in 2006, \"headphones clamped on, brows furrowed in concentration.\"\nDuring the break before the second bridge, at about 1:57 into the song, a barely audible voice (probably Lennon's) can be heard saying, \"Yawn, Paul\", followed by a slightly more audible yawn at 2:00 minutes.

While not on tour, due to his lack of routine, Lennon would often spend his time sleeping, reading, writing or watching television, often under the influence of drugs, and would often have to be woken by McCartney for songwriting sessions. In a London Evening Standard article published on 4 March 1966, which contained quotes from an interview in which Lennon made his \"more popular than Jesus\" remark, Maureen Cleave, a friend of Lennon's, wrote, \"He can sleep almost indefinitely, is probably the laziest person in England.

They initially involved George singing to his own acoustic guitar accompaniment, with Paul supplying backing vocals. The sitar came in at take three and again as an overdub onto take six along with a tabla, bass and fuzz guitar. Lewisohn specifically states: \"George played the sitar but an outside musician, Anil Bhagwat, was recruited to play the tabla.\"\nHarrison had been practising the sitar since he used it to record Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown) in October 1965 (he was soon to do so from its leading exponent Ravi Shankar) and Lavezzoli writes that \"His playing throughout the song is an astonishing improvement over Norwegian Wood. In fact Love You To remains the most accomplished performance on sitar by any rock musician.\" The tabla player on the Song (Anil Bhagwat) made no mention of any other Indian musicians but stated: \"A chap called Angardi called me and asked if I was free that evening to work with George. I didn't know who he meant — he didn't say it was Harrison. It was only when a Rolls Royce came to pick me up that I realised I'd be playing on a Beatles session. When I arrived at Abbey Road there were girls everywhere with Thermos flasks, cakes, sandwiches, waiting for the Beatles to come out. \"George told me what he wanted and I tuned the tabla with him.

I was thinking of it as a song for Ringo, which it eventually turned out to be, so I wrote it as not too rangey in the vocal, then started making a story, sort of an ancient mariner, telling the young kids where he'd lived. It was pretty much my song as I recall... I think John helped out. The lyrics got more and more obscure as it goes on, but the chorus, melody and verses are mine.\" The song began as being about different coloured submarines, but evolved to include only a yellow one.\nIn 1980, Lennon talked about the song: \"'Yellow Submarine' is Paul's baby. Donovan helped with the lyrics. I helped with the lyrics too. We virtually made the track come alive in the studio, but based on Paul's inspiration. Paul's idea. Paul's title... written for Ringo.\" Donovan added the words, \"Sky of blue and sea of green\". McCartney also said: \"It's a happy place, that's all. You know, it was just... We were trying to write a children's song. That was the basic idea. And there's nothing more to be read into it than there is in the lyrics of any children's song.\"\nLennon blew through a straw into a pan of water to create a bubbling effect, McCartney and Lennon talked through tin cans to create the sound of the captain's orders, at 1:38-40 in the song, Ringo stepped outside the doors of the recording room and yelled like a sailor acknowledging \"Cut the cable! Drop the cable!\", which was looped into the song afterwards, and Abbey Road employees John Skinner and Terry Condon twirled chains in a tin bath to create water sounds. After the line, \"and the band begins to play\", Emerick found a recording of a brass band and changed it slightly so it could not be identified, although it is thought to be a recording of Georges Krier and Charles Helmer's 1906 composition, \"Le Rêve Passe\". The original recording had a spoken intro by Starr, but the idea was abandoned on 3 June 1966.\nAlthough intended as a nonsense song for children, \"Yellow Submarine\" received various social and political interpretations at the time; music journalist Peter Doggett wrote that the \"culturally empty\" song \"became a kind of Rorschach test for radical minds.\" The song's chorus was reappropriated by schoolchildren, sports fans, and striking workers in their own chants. At a Mobe protest in San Francisco, a yellow papier-mâché submarine made its way through the crowd, which Time magazine interpreted as a \"symbol of the psychedelic set's desire for escape\". American poet Amiri Baraka criticized the song as an arrogant, solipsistic boast of White people's isolation from the real world. A reviewer for the P.O. Frisco wrote in 1966, \"the Yellow Submarine may suggest, in the context of the Beatles' anti-Vietnam War statement in Tokyo this year, that the society over which Old Glory floats is as isolated and morally irresponsible as a nuclear submarine.\" Writing for Esquire, Robert Christgau felt that the Beatles \"want their meanings to be absorbed on an instinctual level\" and wrote of the interpretations, \"I can't believe that the Beatles indulge in the simplistic kind of symbolism that turns a yellow submarine into a Nembutal or a banana—it is just a yellow submarine, damn it, an obvious elaboration of John [Lennon]'s submarine fixation, first revealed in A Hard Day's Night.\"",Personnel = "Ringo Starr – Lead vocals, drums\n    Paul McCartney – backing vocal, shouting, bass\n  John Lennon – backing vocal, shouting, acoustic guitar\nGeorge Harrison – backing vocal, tambourine\n  Mal Evans – backing vocal, bass drum \n   George Martin – backing vocal, producer\n Geoff Emerick – backing vocal, engineer \n   Neil Aspinall – backing vocal \n  Alf Bicknell – sound effects (rattling chains)\n  Pattie Boyd – backing vocal \n   Marianne Faithfull – backing vocal\n Brian Jones – backing vocal, sound effects (clinking glasses) ", Image1 = "http://olsenbloom.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/beatles-revolver.jpg" ,AudioSrc = "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/71957094/01%20-%20Yellow%20Submarine.mp3" });

The huge Spanish-style house was tucked into the side of a mountain. Soon their address became widely known and the area was besieged by fans who blocked roads and tried to scale the steep canyon while others rented helicopters to spy from overhead. The police department detailed a tactical squad of officers to protect the band and the house. The Beatles found it impossible to leave and instead invited guests including actors Eleanor Bron (who co-starred with them in Help!), Peggy Lipton and folk singer Joan Baez.

Paul and George were on the back patio, and the helicopters were patrolling overhead. They were sitting at a table under an umbrella in a rather comical attempt at privacy. Soon afterwards we dropped acid and began tripping for what would prove to be all night and most of the next day; all of us, including the original Byrds, eventually ended up inside a huge, empty, sunken tub in the bathroom, babbling our minds away.\nI had the privilege of listening to the four of them sing, play around and scheme about what they would compose and achieve. They were so enthusiastic, so full of fun. John was the wittiest and most astute. I enjoyed just hearing him speak and there were no pretensions in his manner. He just sat around, laying out lines of poetry and thinking – an amazing mind.

Fonda said that he knew what it was like to be dead. Lennon snapped, \"Listen mate, shut up about that stuff\", and \"You're making me feel like I've never been born.\" Lennon explained, \"We didn't want to hear about that! We were on an acid trip and the sun was shining and the girls were dancing (some from Playboy, I believe) and the whole thing was really beautiful and Sixties. And this guy - who I really didn't know, he hadn't made Easy Rider or anything - kept coming over, wearing shades, saying 'I know what it's like to be dead,' and we kept leaving him because he was so boring.

The vocals open (on \"When I get near you\" with a harmonious E-A-B-C#-E melody note progression against an A chord, but dissonance soon arises with a II7 (B7) chord pointedly mirroring the lyrics on \"drag me down\".  The dissonance is immediately further enhanced by the rare use of an E7♭9 chord (at 0.46-0.53 secs). This chord has been termed \"one of the most legendary in the entire Beatles catalogue.\" When interviewed about the \"weird, jarring chord at the end of every line that mirrors the disturbed feeling of the song\" Harrison replied: \"That's an E7th with an F on top played on the piano. I'm really proud of that as I literally invented that chord. The song was about the frustration we all feel about trying to communicate certain things with just words. I realised that the chords I knew at the time just didn't capture that feeling. I came up with this dissonant chord that really echoed that sense of frustration. John later borrowed it on I Want You (She's So Heavy) [at] \"It's driving me mad.\"\nThe lyrics are, in Harrison's own words, \"about the avalanche of thoughts that are so hard to write down or say or transmit.\" The frustration in the lyrics is reinforced by the song's dissonant atmosphere, a product of numerous elements, including the continuous piano chord in the background and the contrast between Harrison's modest lead vocal and Lennon and McCartney's descant harmonies.

It was recorded at Abbey Road Studios between 7 April and 17 June 1966 and evolved considerably between the first takes and the final version released on album. The song seems to have been hard to arrange until the soul-style horns, strongly reminiscent of the Stax' Memphis soul and Motown sound, were introduced. The brass was close-miked in the bells of the instruments then put through a limiter. The percussion instrument most predominant is the overdubbed tambourine.\nThe song starts with a blaring brass fanfare, McCartney's vocals entering at 0:07. The chorus of the song appears at 1:04, with the song's title sung. The song then switches between a verse and the refrain. A short electric guitar solo that is nearly identical to the riff from Paperback Writer appears at 1:53 and at 2:10 the horn fanfare re-enters. The song closes with fading vocals of McCartney, much akin to the soul records of the time. The mono and stereo mixes of the recording feature completely different ad libs in the fade-out - the presence of a second vocal track is also far more subtle for most of the mono version. Backing vocals were recorded early but later eliminated.\nIn Barry Miles' 1997 book Paul McCartney: Many Years from Now, McCartney disclosed that the song was about marijuana. \"'Got to Get You into My Life' was one I wrote when I had first been introduced to pot... So [it's] really a song about that, it's not to a person.\" Many lyrics from the song suggest this: \"I took a ride, I didn't know what I would find there / Another road where maybe I could see some other kind of mind there.\",'\"What can I do? What can I be?

Tape loops prepared by the Beatles were mixed in and out of the Indian-inspired modal backing underpinned by Ringo Starr's constant but non-standard drum pattern. The song is also one of the first uses of a flanger effect on any instrument.\nIt is often considered one of the greatest songs of all time, with Pitchfork Media placing it at number 19 on its list of \"The 200 Greatest Songs of the 1960s\", and it being featured in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All-Time.\nJohn Lennon wrote the song in January 1966, with lyrics adapted from the book The Psychedelic Experience: A Manual Based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead by Timothy Leary, Richard Alpert, and Ralph Metzner, which in turn was adapted from the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Although Peter Brown believed that Lennon's source for the lyric was the Tibetan Book of the Dead itself, which, he said, Lennon read whilst consuming LSD, George Harrison later stated that the idea for the lyrics came from Leary's, Alpert's and Metzner's book and Paul McCartney confirmed this, stating that he and Lennon had visited the newly opened Indica bookshop — Lennon was looking for a copy of The Portable Nietzsche — and Lennon had found a copy of The Psychedelic Experience that contained the lines: \"When in doubt, relax, turn off your mind, float downstream\".\nLennon bought the book, went home, took LSD, and followed the instructions exactly as stated in the book. The book held that the \"ego death\" experienced under the influence of LSD and other psychedelic drugs is essentially similar to the dying process and requires similar guidance.\nMcCartney remembered that even though the song's harmony was mainly restricted to the chord of C, Martin accepted it as it was and said it was \"rather interesting\". The song's harmonic structure is derived from Indian music and is based upon a high volume C drone played by Harrison on a tamboura. The \"chord\" over the drone is generally C major, but some changes to B flat major result from vocal modulations, as well as orchestral and guitar tape loops. The song has been called the first pop song that attempted to dispense with chord changes altogether. Here, the Beatles' harmonic ingenuity is nonetheless displayed in the upper harmonies- \"Turn off your mind\", for example, is suitably a run of unvarying E melody notes, before \"relax\" involves an E-G melody note shift and \"float downstream\" an E-C-G descent",Personnel = "John Lennon – double-tracked vocal, Hammond organ and tape loops\n Paul McCartney – bass, backwards guitar solo and tape loops\n George Harrison – sitar, tamboura, and tape loops\n Ringo Starr – drums, tambourine and tape loops\n George Martin – piano, producer\nGeoff Emerick – engineer  ", Image1 = "http://olsenbloom.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/beatles-revolver.jpg" ,AudioSrc = "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/71957094/14%20-%20Tomorrow%20Never%20Knows..mp3" });

The inspiration is said to have come when roadie Mal Evans innocently asked McCartney what the letters \"S\" and \"P\" stood for on the pots on their in-flight meal trays, and McCartney explained it was for salt and pepper. This then led to the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band concept, as well as the song.\nThe group's road manager Neil Aspinall suggested the idea of Sgt. Pepper being the compère, as well as the reprise at the end of the album. According to his diaries, Evans may have also contributed to the song. John Lennon attributed the idea for Sgt. Pepper to McCartney, although the song is officially credited to Lennon–McCartney. The song was recorded in Abbey Road's number 2 studio, with Martin producing, and Geoff Emerick engineering.

It was briefly called \"Bad Finger Boogie\" (later the inspiration for the band name Badfinger), supposedly because Lennon composed the melody on a piano using his middle finger after having hurt his forefinger; but in his 1980 Playboy interview Lennon said: \"This is Paul, with a little help from me. 'What do you see when you turn out the light/ I can't tell you, but I know it's mine...' is mine.\" Lennon also attributed most of the song to McCartney in his 1972 Hit Parader interview: \"Paul. It was Paul's idea. I think I helped with some of the words. In fact, I did. Hunter Davies was there when we did it and mentioned it in the book. 'What do you see when you turn out the light, I can't tell you but I know it's mine.' That was mine.\" McCartney, though, claims at least partial credit for the line, stating: \"I remember giggling with John when we wrote the lines 'What do you see when you turn out the light? I can't tell you, but I know it's mine.' It could have been him playing with his willy under the covers, or it could have been taken on a deeper level.\"\nLennon and McCartney deliberately wrote a tune with a limited range – except for the last note, which McCartney worked closely with Starr to achieve. Speaking in the Anthology, Starr insisted on changing the first line which originally was \"What would you do if I sang out of tune? Would you stand up and throw tomatoes at me?\" He changed the lyric so that fans would not throw tomatoes at him should he perform it live. (In the early days, after George Harrison made a passing comment that he liked jelly babies, the group was showered with them at all of their live performances.)\nThe band started recording the song the day before they posed for the Sgt. Pepper album cover (29 March 1967), wrapping up the session at 5:45 in the morning.

Shortly after the song's release, speculation arose that the first letter of each of the title's nouns intentionally spelled LSD. Although Lennon denied this, the BBC banned the song.\nMuch of the song is in simple triple metre (3/4 time), but the chorus is in 4/4 time. The song modulates between musical keys, using the key of A major for verses, B♭ major for the pre-chorus, and G major for the chorus. It is sung by Lennon over an increasingly complicated underlying arrangement which features a tamboura, played by George Harrison, lead electric guitar put through a Leslie speaker, played by Lennon, and a counter melody on Lowrey organ played by McCartney and taped with a special organ stop sounding \"not unlike a celeste\".\nLennon's inspiration for the song came when his son, Julian, showed him a nursery school drawing he called \"Lucy - in the sky with diamonds\", depicting his classmate, Lucy O'Donnell. Julian said, \"I don't know why I called it that or why it stood out from all my other drawings, but I obviously had an affection for Lucy at that age. I used to show dad everything I'd built or painted at school, and this one sparked off the idea...\" Lucy O'Donnell, in a BBC radio interview in 2007, said, \"I remember Julian and I both doing pictures on a double-sided easel, throwing paint at each other, much to the horror of the classroom attendant... Julian had painted a picture and on that particular day his father turned up with the chauffeur to pick him up from school.\"\nRolling Stone magazine described the song as \"Lennon's lavish daydream\" and music critic Richie Unterberger said \"'Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds' was one of the best songs on The Beatles' famous Sgt. Pepper album, and one of the classic songs of psychedelia as a whole. There are few other songs that so successfully evoke a dream world, in both the sonic textures and words.\" In a review for the BBC, Chris Jones described the song as \"nursery rhyme surrealism\" that contributed to Sgt.

These heavily accented and repetitive lines cause the song to sound as if it is based on a drone. Lead guitarist George Harrison adds an Indian tambura part to the final verse, which further accentuates this impact.\nThe song's title and music suggest optimism, but some of the song's lyrics have a more negative tone. In this sense, it reflects the contrasting personas of the two songwriters. In response to McCartney's line, \"It's getting better all the time\", Lennon replies, \"Can't get no worse!\" Referring to the lyric \"I used to be cruel to my woman/I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved/Man I was mean but I'm changing my scene/And I'm doing the best that I can\", Lennon admitted that he had done things in relationships in the past that he was not proud of.\nOne of the recording sessions for \"Getting Better\" is famous for an incident involving Lennon. During the 21 March 1967 session in which producer George Martin added a piano solo to Lovely Rita, Lennon complained that he did not feel well and could not focus. He had accidentally taken LSD when he meant to take an upper. Unaware of the mistake, Martin took him up to the roof of Abbey Road Studios for some fresh air, and returned to Studio Two where McCartney and Harrison were waiting.

It was my inspiration. We'd seen a story in the newspaper about a young girl who'd left home and not been found, there were a lot of those at the time, and that was enough to give us a story line. So I started to get the lyrics: she slips out and leaves a note and then the parents wake up ... It was rather poignant. I like it as a song, and when I showed it to John, he added the long sustained notes, and one of the nice things about the structure of the song is that it stays on those chords endlessly. Before that period in our song-writing we would have changed chords but it stays on the C chord. It really holds you. It's a really nice little trick and I think it worked very well. While I was showing that to John, he was doing the Greek chorus, the parents' view: 'We gave her most of our lives, we gave her everything money could buy.' I think that may have been in the runaway story, it might have been a quote from the parents. Then there's the famous little line about a man from the motor trade; people have since said that was Terry Doran, who was a friend who worked in a car showroom, but it was just fiction, like the sea captain in \"Yellow Submarine\", they weren't real people.\nThe newspaper story McCartney mentioned was from the front page of the Daily Mirror, about a girl named Melanie Coe. Although McCartney invented most of the content in the song, Coe, who was 17 at the time, claims that most of it was accurate. In actuality, Coe did not \"meet a man from the motor trade\", but instead a croupier, and left in the afternoon while her parents were at work, while the girl in the song leaves early in the morning as her parents sleep. Coe was found ten days later because she had let slip where her boyfriend worked. When she returned home, she was pregnant and had an abortion.\nIn a bizarre coincidence, Coe had actually met McCartney three years earlier when he chose her as the prize winner in a dancing contest on ITV's Ready Steady Go!. An update on Coe appeared in the Daily Mail in May 2008, and she was interviewed about the song on the BBC programme The One Show on 24 November 2010.\nThe day before McCartney wanted to work on the song's score, he learned that George Martin, who usually handled the Beatles' string arrangements, was not available. He contacted Mike Leander, who did it in Martin's place. It was the first time a Beatles song was not arranged by Martin (and the only time it was done with the Beatles' consent: Phil Spector's orchestration of Let It Be was done without McCartney's knowledge). Martin was hurt by McCartney's actions, but he produced the song and conducted the string section.

Lennon explained: \"Everything from the song is from that poster, except the horse wasn't called Henry.\" (The poster identifies the horse as \"Zanthus.\") Mr. Kite is believed to be William Kite, who worked for Pablo Fanque from 1843 to 1845.\nOne of the most musically complex songs on Sgt.

Lennon wanted the track to have a \"carnival atmosphere\", and told producer George Martin that he wanted \"to smell the sawdust on the floor.\" In the middle eight bars, multiple recordings of fairground organs and calliope music were spliced together to attempt to produce this request; after a great deal of unsuccessful experimentation, Martin instructed recording engineer Geoff Emerick to chop the tape into pieces with scissors, throw them up in the air, and re-assemble them at random.\nOn 17 February Lennon sings the words \"For the benefit of Mr. Kite!\" in a joke accent, just before Emerick announces, \"For the Benefit of Mr. Kite! This is take 1.\" Lennon immediately responds, \"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\" reinforcing his title preference, a phrase lifted intact from the original Pablo Fanque poster.

Producer George Martin then arranged a string section, and Harrison and assistant Neil Aspinall overdubbed the tambura. According to Prema Music, dilruba player Amrit Gajjar played on the track. Hunter Davies wrote that Harrison \"trained himself to write down his song in Indian script so that the Indian musicians can play them.\" With \"Within You Without You\", Harrison became the second Beatle to record a song credited to The Beatles but featuring no other members of the group (Paul McCartney had previously done so with \"Yesterday\").\nThe song was also included on the 2006 remix album Love. For this album, George Harrison's vocal and sitar parts were mixed over McCartney's bass and Ringo's drum parts from \"Tomorrow Never Knows,\" although the opening lyric, \"Turn off your mind...Relax and float downstream...It is not dying...it is not dying,\" come from \"Tomorrow Never Knows,\" as does the set of reversed sound effects utilised in the mashup. During part of the second verse of the mashup version, the drums and bass of \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" are silenced, replaced by the tabla percussion parts of \"Within You Without You.\" Also, Harrison's vocals are heard in the song's intended key of C major. The blending of these two songs is considered the most effective form of mashup on the album. All of the music for Love was remixed and remastered by The Beatles' producer Sir George Martin and his son Giles. The Love remix is one of the songs in The Beatles: Rock Band.

Although the theme is ageing, it was one of the first songs McCartney wrote, when he was 16. Played by the Beatles in the early days as a song they could play when the amplifiers broke down or the electricity went off. Both George Martin and Mark Lewisohn speculated that McCartney may have thought of the song when recording began for Sgt. Pepper in December 1966 because his father turned 64 earlier that year.\nLennon said of the song, \"Paul wrote it in the Cavern days. We just stuck a few more words on it like 'grandchildren on your knee' and 'Vera, Chuck and Dave' ... this was just one that was quite a hit with us.\"\nA clarinet trio (two B-flat soprano clarinets and a bass clarinet) is featured prominently in the song, unusual in most music genres, but particularly in the context of rock and roll. Scored by Martin, he said they were added at McCartney's request to \"get around the lurking schmaltz factor\" by using the clarinets \"in a classical way.\" In the song's final verse, the clarinet is played in harmony with McCartney's vocal: an unusual method of harmonisation, especially in 1967. Supporting instruments include the piano, bass, drum set, tubular bells, and electric guitar.\nThe song was recorded on 6 December 1966, during one of the first sessions for the as-yet-unnamed album that became Sgt.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise) is a somewhat modified repeat of the opening song at a faster tempo with heavier instrumentation. The track opens with McCartney's count-in (retained in the manner of I Saw Her Standing There, the first song on their first album); between 2 and 3, Lennon jokingly interjects \"Bye!\". Starr starts the song proper by playing the drum part unaccompanied for four bars, at the end of which a brief bass glissando cues the full ensemble of two distorted guitars, bass, drums and overdubbed percussion. While the original track had stayed largely in the key of G major (except for transient modulation to F and perhaps C in the bridges), the reprise starts in F and features a rare example in the Beatles' output of modulation, to G. The mono and stereo mixes of the song differ slightly: the former has a fractionally different transition from the previous song, and includes crowd noise and laughter in the opening bars that are absent from the stereo mix.\nThe idea for a reprise was Aspinall's, who thought that as there was a \"welcome song\", there should be a \"goodbye song\". The song contains broadly the same melody as the opening version, but with different lyrics and omitting the \"It's wonderful to be here\" section. At 1:18, it is one of the Beatles' shorter songs (the shortest is \"Her Majesty\" at 0:23). The reprise was recorded on 1 April 1967, two months after the version that opens the album.

The decisions to link sections of the song with orchestral glissandos and to end the song with a sustained piano chord were made only after the rest of the song had been recorded.\nAccording to Lennon, the inspiration for the first two verses was the death of Tara Browne, the 21-year-old heir to the Guinness fortune who had crashed his Lotus Elan on 18 December 1966 in Redcliffe Gardens, Earls Court. Browne had been a friend of Lennon and McCartney. Lennon's verses were adapted from a story in the 17 January 1967 edition of the Daily Mail, which reported the coroner's verdict into Browne's death.\n\"I didn't copy the accident,\" Lennon said. \"Tara didn't blow his mind out, but it was in my mind when I was writing that verse. The details of the accident in the song—not noticing traffic lights and a crowd forming at the scene—were similarly part of the fiction.\"\nThe second verse contains the line \"The English Army had just won the war\"; Lennon was making reference to his role in the movie How I Won the War, released on 18 October 1967. In Many Years from Now, McCartney said about the line \"I'd love to turn you on\", which concludes both verse sections: \"This was the time of Tim Leary's 'Turn on, tune in, drop out' and we wrote, 'I'd love to turn you on.' John and I gave each other a knowing look: 'Uh-huh, it's a drug song. You know that, don't you?'.\"\nMcCartney provided the middle section of the song, a short piano piece he had been working on independently, with lyrics about a commuter whose uneventful morning routine leads him to drift off into a dream. John said: \"I had the bulk of the song and the words, but he contributed this little lick floating around in his head that he couldn't use for anything. McCartney had written the piece as a wistful recollection of his younger years, which included riding the bus to school, smoking, and going to class. This theme matched with the original concept of the album which was going to be about their youth. In fact \"Penny Lane\" (a street in Liverpool) and \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" (an orphanage behind Johns' house) were songs first written for the album but were released as an A and B side single as the Beatles were due for 45RPM release. The orchestral crescendos that link the verses and this section were conducted by McCartney and producer George Martin.\nThe final verse was inspired by an article in the Daily Mail in January 1967 regarding a substantial number of potholes in Blackburn, a town in Lancashire. However, Lennon had a problem with the words of the final verse, not being able to think of how to connect \"Now they know how many holes it takes to\" and \"the Albert Hall\". His friend Terry Doran, Managing Director of Apple, suggested that they would \"fill\" the Albert Hall.\nThe orchestral part was recorded on 10 February 1967, with McCartney and Martin conducting a 40-piece orchestra. The recording session was completed at a total cost of £367 (£4,967 as of 2013) for the players, an extravagance at the time.\nMcCartney noted that the strings were able to keep themselves in the designated time, while the trumpets were \"much wilder\". McCartney had originally wanted a 90-piece orchestra, but this proved impossible; the difference was made up, as the semi-improvised segment was recorded multiple times and eventually four different recordings were overdubbed into a single massive crescendo. The results were successful; in the final edit of the song, the orchestral bridge is reprised after the final verse. It was arranged for the orchestral session to be filmed by NEMS Enterprises for use in a planned television special. The film was never released in its entirety, although portions of it can be seen in the \"A Day in the Life\" promotional film, which includes shots of studio guests Mick Jagger, Marianne Faithfull, Keith Richards, Brian Jones, Donovan, Pattie Boyd, and Michael Nesmith. Reflecting the Beatles' taste for experimentation and the avant garde at this point in their careers, the orchestra players were asked to wear or were given a costume piece on top of their formal dress. This resulted in different players wearing anything from fake noses to fake stick-on nipples. Martin recalled that the lead violinist performed wearing a gorilla paw, while a bassoon player placed a balloon on the end of his instrument.\nFollowing the final orchestral crescendo, the song ends with one of the most famous final chords in music history. Lennon, McCartney, Starr, and Evans shared three different pianos, with Martin on the harmonium, and all played an E-major chord simultaneously. The final chord was made to ring out for over forty seconds by increasing the recording sound level as the vibration faded out. Towards the end of the chord the recording level was so high that listeners can hear the sounds of the studio, including rustling papers and a squeaking chair.",Personnel = "John Lennon – lead vocal, acoustic guitar, piano (final chord)\nPaul McCartney – piano (throughout and final chord), bass, lead vocal (middle-eight)\n George Harrison – maracas\n Ringo Starr – drums, congas, piano (final chord)\nOrchestrated by George Martin, John Lennon and Paul McCartney\nConducted by George Martin and Paul McCartney\nJohn Underwood, Gwynne Edwards, Bernard Davis, John Meek – viola\nFrancisco Gabarro, Dennis Vigay, Alan Delziel, Alex Nifosi – cello\nCyril Mac Arther, Gordon Pearce – double bass\nRoger Lord – oboe\nBasil Tschaikov, Jack Brymer – clarinet\nN.

It was recorded on 8 September 1967 with mellotron, guitar, bass, maracas, drums, and tape loops overdubs on 28 September.\n\"Flying\" was originally titled \"Aerial Tour Instrumental\", The end of the recording originally included a fast-paced traditional New Orleans jazz-influenced coda, but this was removed and replaced with an ending featuring tape loops created by John Lennon and Ringo Starr during the 28 September session. The loops initially made the song last 9 minutes 38 seconds, but the track was cut down to only 2 minutes 17 seconds. Part of the loops were used alongside an element of the ending jazz sequence to make \"The Bus\", an incidental piece used at various points, for the TV movie.\nOn the track as recorded and officially released, Lennon plays the main theme on mellotron, accompanied by McCartney and Harrison (both on guitars, plus a later bass overdub) and Starr (on maracas and drums). All four Beatles sing the melody sans lyrics of any kind, and the track fades in an assortment of tape effects created by Lennon and Starr. This released version is identical to that heard on the soundtrack of the Magical Mystery Tour film; the music is accompanied in the film by colour-altered images of landscape in Iceland taken from an aeroplane.\nA different version can be found on some Beatles bootleg albums (such as Back-track 1), and features added Hammond organ and strange whistling noises in the early parts of the track. The jazz-influenced ending is also present on this version, which is slightly shorter, clocking in at around 2:08. This coda, which Mark Lewisohn speculated was \"seemingly copied straight from an unidentifiable modern jazz record\", was in fact played on a mellotron. (In addition to the familiar samples of instruments playing single notes, mellotrons had entire banks of a pop orchestra playing popular styles of music, with optional accompaniment.

The home affords panoramic views of Hollywood and much of the Los Angeles Basin. It is reached from downtown Los Angeles via a complicated street route, difficult to navigate on a foggy night — thus creating the backdrop for the opening lines of the song:\n\"There's a fog upon L.A., and my friends have lost their way.\"\nAccording to Harrison: \"Derek Taylor got held up. He rang to say he'd be late. I told him on the phone that the house was in Blue Jay Way. And he said he could find it OK... he could always ask a cop. So I waited and waited. I felt really knackered with the flight, but I didn't want to go to sleep until he came. There was a fog and it got later and later. To keep myself awake, just as a joke to pass the time while I waited, I wrote a song about waiting for him in Blue Jay Way. There was a little Hammond organ in the corner of this house which I hadn't noticed until then... so I messed around on it and the song came.\"\nThe song was recorded on 6 September 1967, with overdubs on 7 September and 6 October. The vocals are put through a Leslie speaker. The record employs flanging, an audio delay technique, and the stereo and mono mixes differ noticeably. For the stereo version, a full-length copy of the song was played backwards and faded in at key points in the mix. This was not done for the mono or film versions. The television film, Magical Mystery Tour, included the mono mix; the 1990s remastered version used a new stereo mix, sounding closer to the mono mix. The music video for the Magical Mystery Tour film was shot at West Malling, Kent and Weybridge, Surrey on 3 November, the day filming was completed.\nAt the end of the song, there is what might be perceived as a malfunction of the cello tape loop. It is in fact a cover-up of what had been planned to occur in the music video featured in the Magical Mystery Tour film; in the planned ending George was supposed to be hit by the Magical Mystery Tour bus. That ending was never shot, and the revised repeated ending is shown instead.

The second idea was a short rhyme about Lennon sitting in his garden, while the third was a nonsense lyric about sitting on a corn flake. Unable to finish the ideas as three different songs, he combined them into one.\nLennon received a letter from a pupil at Quarry Bank High School, which he had attended. The writer mentioned that the English master was making his class analyse Beatles' lyrics. (Lennon wrote an answer, dated 1 September 1967, which was auctioned by Christie's of London in 1992). Lennon, amused that a teacher was putting so much effort into understanding the Beatles' lyrics, wrote the most confusing lyrics he could. Lennon's friend and former fellow member of The Quarrymen, Peter Shotton, was visiting, and Lennon asked Shotton about a playground nursery rhyme they sang as children.\nShotton remembered:\nYellow matter custard, green slop pie,\nAll mixed together with a dead dog's eye,\nSlap it on a butty, ten foot thick,\n  Then wash it all down with a cup of cold sick.\nLennon borrowed a couple of words, added the three unfinished ideas and the result was \"I Am the Walrus\". The Beatles' official biographer Hunter Davies was present while the song was being written and wrote an account in his 1968 biography of the Beatles. Lennon remarked to Shotton, \"Let the fuckers work that one out.\" Shotton was also responsible for suggesting to Lennon to change the lyric \"waiting for the man to come\" to \"waiting for the van to come\".\nLennon explained much of the song to Playboy in 1980:\n-\"The first line was written on one acid trip one weekend. The second line was written on the next acid trip the next weekend, and it was filled in after I met Yoko... I'd seen Allen Ginsberg and some other people who liked Dylan and Jesus going on about Hare Krishna. It was Ginsberg, in particular, I was referring to. The words 'Element'ry penguin' meant that it's naïve to just go around chanting Hare Krishna or putting all your faith in one idol. In those days I was writing obscurely, à la Dylan.\"\n-\"It never dawned on me that Lewis Carroll was commenting on the capitalist system. I never went into that bit about what he really meant, like people are doing with the Beatles' work. Later, I went back and looked at it and realized that the walrus was the bad guy in the story and the carpenter was the good guy. I thought, Oh, shit, I picked the wrong guy. I should have said, 'I am the carpenter.' But that wouldn't have been the same, would it? [Sings, laughing] 'I am the carpenter....'\"\nAll the chords are major chords or seventh chords, and all the musical letters of the alphabet (A, B, C, D, E, F and G) are used. The song ends using a Shepard tone, with a chord progression built on ascending and descending lines in the bass and strings, repeated over and over as the song fades. Musicologist Alan W. Pollack analyses: \"The chord progression of the outro itself is a harmonic Moebius strip with scales in bassline and top voice that move in contrary motion.\" The bassline descends stepwise A, G, F, E, D, C, and B, while the strings' part rises A, B, C, D, E, F#, G: this sequence repeats as the song fades, with the strings rising higher on each iteration. Pollack also notes that the repeated cell is seven bars long, which means that a different chord begins each four-bar phrase.\n\"I Am the Walrus\" was the first studio recording made after the death of the Beatles' manager Brian Epstein in August 1967. The basic backing track featuring the Beatles was released in 1996 on Anthology 2. George Martin arranged and added orchestral accompaniment that included violins, cellos, horns, clarinet and a 16-piece choir. Paul McCartney said that Lennon gave instructions to Martin as to how he wished the orchestration to be scored, including singing most of the parts as a guide. A large group of professional studio vocalists named the Mike Sammes Singers, took part in the recording as well, variously singing \"Ho-ho-ho, hee-hee-hee, ha-ha-ha\", \"oompah, oompah, stick it up your jumper!\", \"everybody's got one\" and making a series of shrill whooping noises. The recording is another Beatles song with an unrelated coda, in the shape of new parts of strings, new choruses and the sampling of a radio in its fade-out.\nThe dramatic reading in the mix towards the end of the song is a few lines of Shakespeare's King Lear (Act IV, Scene VI), which were added to the song direct from an AM radio Lennon was fiddling with that happened to be receiving the broadcast of the play on the BBC Third Programme. The excerpt begins at Act IV, Sc vi,II lines 224-25, most pointedly (given Lennon's problematic history with his own father) where the disguised Edgar talks to his estranged and maliciously blinded father the Earl of Gloucester: Glo: \"Now good sir, what are you? Edg: A most poor man, made tame to fortune's blows.\" Edgar then kills Oswald the steward of Goneril (who cries out \"Slave, thou has't slain me\"). Edgar describes the dead Oswald in words heard in the song's coda as a \"serviceable villain.\" Gloucester asks \"What, is he dead?\" and Edgar replies \"Sit ye down father rest you.\"\nSeen in the Magical Mystery Tour film singing the song, Lennon, apparently, is the walrus; on the track-list of the accompanying soundtrack EP/LP however, underneath \"I Am the Walrus\" are printed the words ' \"No you're not!\" said Little Nicola' (in the film, Nicola is a little girl who keeps contradicting everything the other characters say). Lennon returned to the subject in the lyrics of three of his subsequent songs: in the 1968 Beatles song \"Glass Onion\" he sings \"now here's another clue for you all — the walrus was Paul\"; in the third verse of \"Come Together\" he sings the line \"he bag production, he got walrus gumboot\", and in his 1970 solo song \"God\", admits \"I was the walrus, but now I'm John.\"",Personnel = "John Lennon – lead vocal, electric piano, mellotron\n Paul McCartney – bass, tambourine, backing vocal \n  George Harrison – electric guitar, backing vocal\n Ringo Starr – drums\n  Orchestrated, directed and produced by George Martin.\n Session musicians – strings, brass and woodwinds\nMike Sammes singers – backing vocals  ", Image1 = "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/85/TheBeatlesMagicalMysteryTouralbumcover.jpg/220px-TheBeatlesMagicalMysteryTouralbumcover.jpg" ,AudioSrc = "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/71957094/06%20-%20I%20Am%20The%20Walrus.mp3" });

Taylor later said, \"I wonder whether Paul really made up that song as he went along or whether it was running through his head already.\"\nUnder the working title \"Hello Hello\", the Beatles recorded the backing track on 2 October 1967, and added vocals and a guitar overdub on the 19th. After further overdubs of bass guitar and viola, recording was completed on 2 November, and mixing on the 6th. \"Hello Goodbye\" is in the key of C Major and in 4/4 time.\nThe song features a coda which came spontaneously in the studio. Of this, McCartney said \"I remember the end bit where there's the pause and it goes 'Heba, heba hello'. We had those words and we had this whole thing recorded but it didn't sound quite right, and I remember asking Geoff Emerick if we could really whack up the echo on the tom-toms. And we put this echo full up on the tom-toms and it just came alive.\"\n\"Hello, Goodbye\" was released as a single on 24 November 1967. In the US, the song was also included on the Magical Mystery Tour album released three days later, but the song was not made available in the UK on an album (or in stereo) until the release of the 1973 compilation album 1967–1970.\nWith the release of the song, McCartney gave an explanation of its meaning in an interview with Disc: \"The answer to everything is simple.

Lennon and his childhood friends Pete Shotton, Nigel Walley, and Ivan Vaughan used to play in the wooded garden behind the home. One of Lennon's childhood treats was the garden party held each summer in Calderstones Park near the Salvation Army Home every year, where a Salvation Army band played. Lennon's aunt Mimi Smith recalled: \"As soon as we could hear the Salvation Army band starting, John would jump up and down shouting, 'Mimi, come on. We're going to be late.'\"\nLennon's \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" and McCartney's \"Penny Lane\" shared the theme of nostalgia for their early years in Liverpool. Although both referred to actual locations, the two songs also had strong surrealistic and psychedelic overtones. Producer George Martin said that when he first heard \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", he thought it conjured up a \"hazy, impressionistic dreamworld\".\nThe period of the song's writing was one of change and dislocation for Lennon. The Beatles had just retired from touring after one of the most difficult periods of their career, including the \"more popular than Jesus\" controversy and the band's unintentional snubbing of Philippines First Lady Imelda Marcos. Lennon's marriage with Cynthia Powell was failing, and he was using increasing quantities of drugs, especially the powerful psychedelic LSD, as well as cannabis, which he had smoked during his time in Spain. Lennon talked about the song in 1980: \"I was different all my life. The second verse goes, 'No one I think is in my tree.' Well, I was too shy and self-doubting. Nobody seems to be as hip as me is what I was saying. Therefore, I must be crazy or a genius—'I mean it must be high or low' \", and explaining that the song was \"psycho-analysis set to music\".\nLennon began writing the song in Almería, Spain, during the filming of Richard Lester's How I Won the War in September–October 1966. The earliest demo of the song, recorded in Almería, had no refrain and only one verse: \"There's no one on my wavelength / I mean, it's either too high or too low / That is you can't you know tune in but it's all right / I mean it's not too bad\". He revised the words to this verse to make them more obscure, then wrote the melody and part of the lyrics to the refrain (which then functioned as a bridge and did not yet include a reference to Strawberry Fields). He then added another verse and the mention of Strawberry Fields. The first verse on the released version was the last to be written, close to the time of the song's recording. For the refrain, Lennon was again inspired by his childhood memories: the words \"nothing to get hung about\" were inspired by Aunt Mimi's strict order not to play in the grounds of Strawberry Field, to which Lennon replied, \"They can't hang you for it.\" The first verse Lennon wrote became the second in the released version, and the second verse Lennon wrote became the last in the release.\nThe song was originally written on acoustic guitar in the key of C major. The recorded version is approximately in B-flat major; owing to manipulation of the recording speed, the finished version is not in standard pitch (some, for instance consider that the tonic is A). The introduction was played by McCartney on a Mellotron, and involves a I- ii- I- ♭VII- IV progression The vocals enter with the refrain instead of a verse. In fact we are not \"taken down\" to the tonic key, but to \"non-diatonic chords and secondary dominants\" combining with \"chromatic melodic tension intensified through outrageous harmonisation and root movement\". The phrase \"to Strawberry\" for example begins with a highly dissonant G melody note against a prevailing F minor key, then uses extremely dissonant B♭ and B notes (against the Fm chord) until the consonant F note is reached on \"Fields\". \nThe working title was \"It's Not Too Bad\", and Geoff Emerick, the sound engineer, remembered it being \"just a great, great song, that was apparent from the first time John sang it for all of us, playing an acoustic guitar.\" Recording began on 24 November 1966, in Abbey Road's Studio Two on a 4-track machine. It took 45 hours to record, spread over five weeks. The song was meant to be on the band's 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, but was released as a single instead.\nThe band recorded three distinct versions of the song. After Lennon played the song for the other Beatles on his acoustic guitar, the band recorded the first take. Lennon played an Epiphone Casino; McCartney played a Mellotron, a new home instrument purchased by Lennon on August 12, 1965, (with another model hired in after encouragement from Mike Pinder of The Moody Blues); Starr played drums, and Harrison played electric guitar. The first recorded take began with the verse, \"Living is easy...\", instead of the chorus, \"Let me take you down\", which starts the released version. The first verse also led directly to the second, with no chorus between. Lennon's vocals were automatically double-tracked from the words \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" through the end of the last verse. The last verse, \"Always, no sometimes...\", has three-part harmonies, with McCartney and Harrison singing \"dreamy background vocals\". This version was soon abandoned and went unreleased until the The Beatles Anthology series in 1996.\nFour days later the band reassembled to try a different arrangement. The second version of the song featured McCartney's Mellotron introduction followed by the refrain. They recorded five takes of the basic tracks for this arrangement (two of which were false starts) with the last being chosen as best and subjected to further overdubs. Lennon's final vocal was recorded with the tape running fast so that when played back at normal speed the tonality would be altered, giving his voice a slurred sound. This version was used for the first minute of the released recording.\nAfter recording the second version of the song, Lennon wanted to do something different with it, as Martin remembered: \"He'd wanted it as a gentle dreaming song, but he said it had come out too raucous. He asked me if I could write him a new line-up with the strings. So I wrote a new score (with four trumpets and three cellos) and we recorded that, but he didn't like it.\" Meanwhile, on 8 and 9 December, another basic track was recorded, using a Mellotron, electric guitar, piano, backwards-recorded cymbals, and the swarmandel (or swordmandel), an Indian version of the zither. After reviewing the tapes of Martin's version and the original, Lennon told Martin that he liked both versions, although Martin had to tell Lennon that the orchestral score was at a faster tempo and in a higher key (B major) than the first version (A major). Lennon said, \"You can fix it, George\", giving Martin and Emerick the difficult task of joining the two takes together. With only a pair of editing scissors, two tape machines, and a vari-speed control, Emerick compensated for the differences in key and speed by increasing the speed of the first version and decreasing the speed of the second. He then spliced the versions together, starting the orchestral score in the middle of the second chorus. (Since the first version did not include a chorus after the first verse, he also spliced in the first seven words of the chorus from elsewhere in the first version.) The pitch-shifting in joining the versions gave Lennon's lead vocal a slightly other-worldly \"swimming\" quality.\nSome vocalising by Lennon is faintly audible at the end of the song, picked up as leakage onto one of the drum microphones (close listening shows Lennon making other comments to Ringo). In the \"Paul is Dead\" hoax these were taken to be Lennon saying \"I buried Paul.\" In 1974, McCartney said, \"That wasn't 'I buried Paul' at all—that was John saying 'cranberry sauce'. It was the end of Strawberry Fields. That's John's humour. John would say something totally out of sync, like cranberry sauce. If you don't realise that John's apt to say cranberry sauce when he feels like it, then you start to hear a funny little word there, and you think, 'Aha!'\"\n\"Strawberry Fields Forever\" was well received by critics, and is still considered a classic. Three weeks after its release, Time magazine hailed the song as \"the latest sample of the Beatles' astonishing inventiveness\". Richie Unterberger of Allmusic hailed the song as \"one of The Beatles' peak achievements and one of the finest Lennon-McCartney songs\". Ian MacDonald wrote in Revolution in the Head that it \"shows expression of a high order... few if any [contemporary composers] are capable of displaying feeling and fantasy so direct, spontaneous, and original.\" In 2004, this song was ranked number 76 on Rolling Stone's list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\". In 2010, Rolling Stone placed it at number three on the 100 Greatest Beatles Songs. The song was ranked as the second-best Beatles’ song by Mojo, after \"A Day in the Life\".\nBrian Wilson of the Beach Boys said that \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" was partially responsible for the shelving of his group's legendary unfinished album, Smile. Wilson first heard the song on his car radio whilst driving, and was so affected that he had to stop and listen to it all the way through. He then remarked to his passenger that the Beatles had already reached the sound the Beach Boys had wanted to achieve. Paul Revere & the Raiders were among the most successful US groups during 1966 and 1967, having their own Dick Clark-produced television show, Where the Action Is.

McCartney and Lennon would meet at Penny Lane junction in the Wavertree area to catch a bus into the centre of the city. The area that surrounds its junction with Smithdown Road, Smithdown Place and Allerton Road is also commonly called Penny Lane. At the time, in the 1960s, this was a significant bus terminus for several routes, and buses with \"Penny Lane\" displayed were common throughout Liverpool.\nLocally the term \"Penny Lane\" was the name given to the area which includes Smithdown Place (where the terminus was located) and where Allerton Road becomes Smithdown Road and its busy shopping area. Penny Lane is named after James Penny, an 18th century slave trader. The street is an important landmark, sought out by most Beatles fans touring Liverpool. In the past, street signs saying \"Penny Lane\" were constant targets of tourist theft and had to be continually replaced. Eventually, city officials gave up and simply began painting the street name on the sides of buildings. This practice was stopped in 2007 and more theft-resistant \"Penny Lane\" street signs have since been installed though some are still stolen.\nBeatles producer George Martin has stated he believes the pairing of \"Penny Lane\" with \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" resulted in probably the greatest single ever released by the band. Both songs were later included on the US Magical Mystery Tour album in November 1967. In the UK, the pairing famously failed to reach No. 1 in the singles charts, stalling one place below Engelbert Humperdinck's \"Release Me\". In the US the song reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for a week before being knocked off by The Turtles song \"Happy Together\". The song features contrasting verse-chorus form.\nThe single was released following the success of the double A-side \"Yellow Submarine\"/\"Eleanor Rigby\", when Brian Epstein enquired if the band had any new material available. Since the Beatles usually did not include songs released as singles on their British albums, both songs were left off the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album, a decision Martin later regretted.",Personnel = "Paul McCartney – lead, harmony and backing vocals, three pianos and bass\n John Lennon – harmony and backing vocals, two pianos, congas and handclaps\n George Harrison – backing vocal, handbell and handclaps\nRingo Starr – drums, tambourine\n George Martin – piano, production, orchestration\n  David Mason – piccolo trumpet solo\n Ray Swinfield, P.

It is a clear message saying that love is everything.\"According to journalist Jade Wright, \"Lennon was fascinated by the power of slogans to unite people and never afraid to create art out of propaganda. When asked in 1971 whether songs like \"Give Peace a Chance\" and \"Power to the People\" were propaganda songs, he answered: 'Sure. So was All You Need Is Love. I'm a revolutionary artist. My art is dedicated to change.'\"\nThe day before the Our World broadcast, the Beatles decided that the song should be their next single. Released in the UK on 7 July 1967, it went straight to number one and remained there for three weeks. It was similarly successful in the United States after its release on 17 July, reaching number one for a week. It was also included on the American LP version of Magical Mystery Tour in November as well as in the film, and on the LP Yellow Submarine, released in 1969. This song is also featured in the Cirque du Soleil's show \"Love\", based on the songs of The Beatles, which has been performing in Las Vegas since 2006.\nFor the broadcast, the Beatles were (except for Starr) seated on stools, accompanied by a small studio orchestra. They were surrounded by friends and acquaintances seated on the floor, many of whom were among the leading stars of the British pop scene, who sang with the refrain during the fade-out.\nLennon, affecting indifference, was said to be nervous about the broadcast, given the potential size of the international TV audience. Dissatisfied with his singing, he re-recorded the solo verses for use on the single. Starr also overdubbed drums before the single was released, fixing the aforementioned timing problems and adding the drum roll.\nThe programme was broadcast in 'black-and-white' (colour television had yet to commence broadcasting in Britain and most of the world).

Propelled throughout by McCartney's uptempo piano playing and lead guitar riffs, the lyrics tell of the singer's great happiness on returning home, where \"the Ukraine girls really knock me out\" and the \"Moscow girls make me sing and shout\" (and are invited to \"Come and keep your comrade warm\"). He also looks forward to hearing the sound of \"balalaikas ringing out\"\nPaul McCartney wrote this song while the Beatles were in Rishikesh, India, learning Transcendental Meditation. The title of the song is a tribute to Chuck Berry's \"Back in the U.S.A.\" while the chorus and background vocals pay homage to the Beach Boys' \"California Girls\". Mike Love of the Beach Boys also attended the retreat in Rishikesh at the same time; he has stated in interviews that, in order to make the song sound more like a Beach Boys number, he encouraged McCartney to \"talk about the girls all around Russia, the Ukraine and Georgia\" in the lyrics. The song also contains a pun on Hoagy Carmichael's and Stuart Gorrell's \"Georgia on My Mind\". McCartney sings about the female population of the Soviet Republic of Georgia (\"and Georgia's always on my mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mind\") right after \"the Ukraine girls\" and \"Moscow girls.\" McCartney thought that when he listened to the Beach Boys, it sounded like California, so he decided to write a song that \"sounded\" like the U.S.S.R. The title was inspired in part by the I'm Backing Britain campaign that had been endorsed by British Prime Minister Harold Wilson. It has been suggested that McCartney twisted that into \"I'm back in (backin') the U.S.S.R.\"\nDuring the 1960s, the Beatles were officially derided in the USSR as the \"belch of Western culture\" and in the 1980s McCartney was refused permission to play there. According to The Moscow Times, when McCartney finally got to play the song at his concert in Moscow's Red Square in May 2003 at the age of 60 \"the crowd went wild\". When asked about the song before the concert McCartney said he had known little about the Soviet Union when he wrote it. \"It was a mystical land then,\" he said. \"It's nice to see the reality. I always suspected that people had big hearts. Now I know that's true.\" \"Finally we got to do that one here,\" he said after the song.\nThe White Album sessions allowed the four members to work on separate projects at the same time and, as a result, kept tensions to a minimum. However, tempers flared during the recording session on 22 August 1968, and Ringo Starr walked out and announced that he had quit.\n\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\" and \"Dear Prudence,\" the first two tracks of the album, were recorded without Starr, with McCartney primarily responsible for the drum parts. McCartney's drums are most prominent in the mix, but both John Lennon and George Harrison also recorded drum parts for \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\"; these are audible in the left channel of the stereo mix. The Beach Boys played \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\" when Ringo Starr joined them for a live show. It is the only time he is known to have performed the song. However, Starr appeared in the animated song clip shown on The Beatles: Rock Band.\nAfter the other Beatles urged him to return, Starr rejoined the group almost two weeks later on 4 September 1968 when he participated in the filming of a promotional video for \"Hey Jude.\" The other Beatles covered his drum kit in flowers to welcome him back. During a break in the filming of the \"Hey Jude\" video, Marc Sinden (who appears in the film) recalls Lennon playing a song on his acoustic guitar. \"Everyone went 'Wow'...

John Lennon was asked to \"contact her and make sure she came out more often to socialize\". As a result, Lennon wrote the song \"Dear Prudence\". In the song Lennon asks Farrow to \"open up your eyes\" and \"see the sunny skies\" reminding her that she is \"part of everything\". The song was said to be \"a simple plea to a friend to 'snap out of it'\". Lennon said later that \"She'd been locked in for three weeks and was trying to reach God quicker than anyone else\". According to Farrow: \"I would always rush straight back to my room after lectures and meals so I could meditate. John, George and Paul would all want to sit around jamming and having a good time and I'd be flying into my room. They were all serious about what they were doing, but they just weren't as fanatical as me\"\nLennon did play the song for Farrow while they were in India together.

The starting lyric: - \"Desmond has a barrow in the market-place\" was a reference to the first internationally renown Jamaican ska and reggae performer Desmond Dekker who had just had a successful tour of the UK. The tag line \"ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra\" was an expression used by Nigerian conga player Jimmy Scott-Emuakpor, an acquaintance of McCartney.\nDuring May 1968, the Beatles gathered at George Harrison's Esher home, in Surrey, to record demos for their upcoming project. \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\" was one of the twenty-seven demos recorded there. Paul performed this demo solo, with only an acoustic guitar. He had also double-tracked his vocal, which was not perfectly synchronised, creating an echoing effect.\nAccording to studio engineer Geoff Emerick, John Lennon \"openly and vocally detested\" the song.Lennon left the studio during a recording of the song (after several days and literally dozens of takes of the song, trying different tempos and styles), then returned while under the influence of marijuana, went immediately to the piano and played the opening chords much louder and faster than before. He claimed that was how the song should be played, and that is the version they ended up using.\nWhen singing the vocals for the song, specifically the last verse of the song when sung the second time, McCartney made a slip and said \"Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face\", rather than Molly, and had Molly letting \"the children lend a hand\".

Cooke III, known as Rik who was visiting his mother, Nancy Cooke de Herrera, at the ashram of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in Rishikesh at the same time that The Beatles were staying with the Maharishi. According to his mother, both she and her son maintained friendly relations with all of The Beatles except for Lennon, who by Cooke de Herrera's account was \"a genius\" but distant and contemptuous of the wealthy American Cooke de Herrera and her clean-cut, college-attending son. According to Nancy's life account, Beyond Gurus, the genesis of the song occurred when she, Rik, and several others, including guides, set out upon elephants to hunt for a tiger (allegedly presented by their Indian guide as a traditional act). The pack of elephants was attacked by a tiger, which was shot by Rik. Rik was initially proud of his quick reaction and posed for a photograph with his prize. However, Rik's reaction to the slaying was mixed, as he has not hunted since. Nancy claims that all present recognised the necessity of Rik's action, but that John Lennon's reaction was scornful and sarcastic, asking Rik: \"But wouldn't you call that slightly life-destructive?\" The song was written by Lennon as mocking what he saw as Rik's bravado and unenlightened attitude.\nLennon later told his version of the story in a Playboy interview, stating that: \"‘Bungalow Bill’ was written about a guy in Maharishi's meditation camp who took a short break to go shoot a few poor tigers, and then came back to commune with God. There used to be a character called Jungle Jim, and I combined him with Buffalo Bill. It's sort of a teenage social-comment song and a bit of a joke.\" Mia Farrow, who was also at the ashram during the period, supports Lennon's story in her autobiography; she writes, \"Then a self-important, middle-aged American woman arrived, moving a mountain of luggage into the brand-new private bungalow next to Maharishi's along with her son, a bland young man named Bill. People fled this newcomer, and no one was sorry when she left the ashram after a short time to go tiger hunting, unaware that their presence had inspired a new Beatles' song - 'Bungalow Bill.'\"",Personnel = "John Lennon – lead vocal, acoustic guitar, organ, Mellotron\n Paul McCartney – bass guitar, backing vocal\nGeorge Harrison – backing vocal, acoustic guitar\n Ringo Starr – drums, tambourine, backing vocal\n Chris Thomas – Mellotron\n  Yoko Ono – brief co-lead vocal, backing vocal\n Maureen Starkey – backing vocal  ", Image1 = "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/TheBeatles68LP.jpg/220px-TheBeatles68LP.jpg" ,AudioSrc = "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/71957094/06%20-%20The%20Continuing%20Story%20Of%20Bungalow%20Bill.mp3" });

Taking this idea of relativism to his parents' home in northern England, Harrison committed to write a song based on the first words he saw upon opening a random book. Those words were \"gently weeps\", and he immediately began the song. As he said:\n\"I wrote \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" at my mother's house in Warrington. I was thinking about the Chinese I Ching, the Book of Changes... The Eastern concept is that whatever happens is all meant to be, and that there's no such thing as coincidence - every little item that's going down has a purpose. \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" was a simple study based on that theory. I decided to write a song based on the first thing I saw upon opening any book - as it would be relative to that moment, at that time. I picked up a book at random, opened it, saw 'gently weeps', then laid the book down again and started the song.\"\nThe band recorded the song several times. Take I on 25 July 1968 involved Harrison on his J-200 guitar and an overdubbed harmonium. Sessions on 16 August and 3 and 5 September included a version with a backward guitar solo (as Harrison had done for \"I'm Only Sleeping\" on Revolver), but Harrison was not satisfied. On 6 September 1968, during a ride from Surrey into London, Harrison asked his friend Eric Clapton to add a lead guitar solo to the song. Clapton was reluctant; he said, \"Nobody ever plays on the Beatles' records\"; but Harrison convinced him and Clapton's solo, using a Gibson Les Paul guitar, was recorded that evening. Harrison later said that in addition to his solo, Clapton's presence had another effect on the band: \"It made them all try a bit harder; they were all on their best behaviour.\"\nTowards the end of the song, Harrison's voice is heard crying: \"Oh, Oh\", which some of the Beatles fans thought that he was crying: \"Paul, Paul\", indicating that theory about Paul McCartney being dead, and that George was weeping for Paul.\nThe song is in Am, with a shift to a ♭7 (Am/G) on \"all\" (bass note G) and a 6 (D9 (major 3rd F#)) after \"love\" (bass note F#) to a ♭6 (Fmaj7) on \"sleeping\" (bass note F). This 8-♭7-6-♭6 progression has been described as an Aeolian/Dorian hybrid. Everett notes that the change from the minor mode verse (A-B) to the parallel major for the bridge might express hope that \"unrealized potential\" described in the lyrics is to be \"fulfilled,\" but that the continued minor triads (III, VI and II) \"seem to express a strong dismay that love is not to be unfolded.\"",Personnel = "George Harrison – double-tracked vocal, backing vocal, acoustic guitar\nPaul McCartney – harmony vocal, bass, piano, Hammond organ\nJohn Lennon – electric guitar\nRingo Starr – drums, tambourine, castane\nEric Clapton – lead guitar  ", Image1 = "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/TheBeatles68LP.jpg/220px-TheBeatles68LP.jpg" ,AudioSrc = "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/71957094/07%20-%20While%20My%20Guitar%20Gently%20Weeps.mp3" });

It was a gun magazine. I just thought it was a fantastic, insane thing to say. A warm gun means you just shot something.\" The reference, whether or not intermediately from the magazine, was one of many 1960s riffs on Charles M. Schulz's culturally popular saying, Happiness is a Warm Puppy, which began in the Peanuts comic strip and became a widely sold book.\nLennon said he \"put together three sections of different songs...it seemed to run through all the different kinds of rock music.\". The song begins with a brief lilting section (\"She's not a girl who misses much...\"). Drums, bass and distorted guitar enter as this portion of the song proceeds. The surreal imagery from this section is allegedly taken from an acid trip that Lennon and Derek Taylor experienced, with Taylor contributing the opening lines. After this, the song transitions into a song fragment called \"I Need a Fix,\" built around an ominous-sounding guitar riff. This section drifts into the next section, a chorus of \"Mother Superior jumped the gun.\" The final section is a doo-wop send up, with the back-up of vocals of \"bang, bang, shoot shoot.\"\nOne of the most salient musical features of the song is its frequent shifts in time signature, some tempo changes, and some unusual phrasing. The song begins in standard 4/4 time but quickly deviates from the norm. There is a 5-bar phrase rather than the usual 4, beginning with the line \"She's well acquainted...\". The last line of that verse (\"A soap impression of his wife...\") has a 6/4 bar (the second measure of the phrase) before going back to 4/4 for the last two bars of the phrase, and Ringo Starr plays the downbeat on \"1\" in the fourth bar, giving a more unusual feel. The subsequent guitar lead and bridge can be analysed as a 3-bar pattern of 9/8, 12/8, 12/8, with Ringo retaining an implied 6/8 throughout, so that the snare drum downbeats are on \"1\" as often as not. This gives way to a faster 4-bar pattern of 6/8, 6/4, 6/8, 7/4 for the \"Mother Superior...\" section before returning to a slower 4/4 for the doo-wop ending. During the \"When I hold you...\" section, the rest of the band returns to 6/8, but Ringo stays in 4/4. This is a rare example of polyrhythm in The Beatles' catalogue.\n\"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\" is reportedly Paul McCartney's and George Harrison's favourite song on the White Album. Although tensions were high among the band during the album's recording sessions, they reportedly collaborated as a close unit to work out the song's challenging rhythmic and meter issues, and consequently considered it one of the few true \"Beatles\" songs on the album.",Personnel = "John Lennon – double-tracked vocal, backing vocals, guitar\nPaul McCartney – bass guitar, backing vocals\nGeorge Harrison – fuzzed lead guitar, backing vocals\n Ringo Starr – drums, tambourine  ", Image1 = "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/TheBeatles68LP.jpg/220px-TheBeatles68LP.jpg" ,AudioSrc = "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/71957094/08%20-%20Happiness%20Is%20A%20Warm%20Gun.mp3" });

One of dozens of songs the Beatles wrote in India, \"I'm So Tired\" detailed Lennon's fragile state of mind. It was also an open letter to Ono, whose postcards to Lennon in India were a lifeline. \"I got so excited about her letters,\" he said. \"I started thinking of her as a woman, and not just an intellectual woman.\" Lennon later said of it: \"One of my favourite tracks.

Bach's Bourrée in E minor, a well known lute piece, often played on the classical guitar.\nAs children, he and George Harrison tried to learn Bourrée as a \"show off\" piece. The Bourrée is distinguished by melody and bass notes played simultaneously on the upper and lower strings. McCartney adapted a segment of the Bourrée (reharmonised into the original's relative major key of G) as the opening of \"Blackbird\", and carried the musical idea throughout the song.\nMcCartney was inspired to write it while in Scotland as a reaction to racial tensions escalating in the United States in the spring of 1968.\nAlso, before his solo acoustic guitar set during the Driving USA Tour, McCartney explained that \"bird\" is British slang for girl, making \"blackbird\" a synonym for 'black girl'. Near the end of the song's performance, a young black woman sang the lyrics, \"You were only waiting for this moment to arrive, blackbird fly...\", after which the program faded to commercial.\nIn 2009, McCartney performed this song at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, commenting prior to singing it on how it had been written in response to the 1960s Civil Rights movement, and added, \"It's so great to realise so many civil rights issues have been overcome.\"\nThe instrumentation consists of tapping, guitar, vocal and birdsong overdub. The tapping \"has been incorrectly identified as a metronome in the past\", according to engineer Geoff Emerick, who says it is actually the sound of Paul tapping his foot, which Emerick recalls as being mic'd up separately.

Harrison's mother provided the line \"What they need's a damn good whacking\", and Lennon contributed the line \"clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon.\" There was an additional verse written for the song in 1968 but omitted during the actual recording. It involved the \"piggies\" playing \"piggy pranks\" in order to achieve its rhyming couplet of \"piggy banks.\" Harrison reinstated this verse in all live performances of the song in the 1990s. \nThe original lyrics read \"to cut their pork chops\" (as heard on the Anthology 3 album). Lennon created the tape loop for the pig noises that were sampled for this song. Everett refers to the lyrics as involving an \"Orwellian comparison of pigs to socially horrid though outwardly refined tyrants.\"\nThe mono version (originally released on an LP mono incarnation of The Beatles) has the pig sounds positioned differently from that of the stereo recording. The Beatles in Mono box set contains a version of The Beatles featuring this mono mix. \"Piggies\" is sandwiched between two other songs with animals in their titles (\"Blackbird\" and \"Rocky Raccoon\"). This was a deliberate decision on the part of Lennon and McCartney while preparing the sequencing of the songs for the album.\nCharles Manson derived personal meaning from many songs of The White Album. \"Piggies\" was used in particular to justify attacks on the White establishment, with the lyrics \"what they need's a damn good whacking\" reflecting the attacks on Blacks in what Manson envisioned would be an apocalyptic race war. During the murders of Sharon Tate, Leno and Rosemary LaBianca, Gary Hinman and others, the words 'political piggy', 'pig' and 'death to pigs' were written with the victims' blood on the walls.

The Old West-style honky-tonk piano was played by producer George Martin. The lyrics describe a conflict over a love triangle.\nDuring take 8 of the song (featured on Anthology 3), Paul McCartney flubbed the line \"stinking of gin\", singing \"sminking\" instead. This caused him to laugh, exclaim \"Sminking?!\" and make up the remaining lines in the song.

It was written during the Beatles' 1968 visit to Rishikesh in northern India, where they were studying under the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. It was here where Lennon learned the song's finger-picking guitar style (known as 'Travis-picking') from the Scottish musician Donovan. No other Beatle sings or plays on the song. While Paul McCartney made several \"solo\" recordings attributed to the group, dating back to his famous song \"Yesterday\", this is the only time that Lennon played and sang unaccompanied on a Beatle track.\n\"Julia\" was written for John's mother, Julia Lennon (1914–1958), who was knocked down and killed by a car driven by a drunk off-duty police officer when John was 17 years old. Julia Lennon had encouraged her son's interest in music and bought him his first guitar. But after splitting with John's father, she started a new family with another man and left John to be raised by her sister, Mimi; though she lived just a few miles from John, Julia did not spend much time with him for a number of years. Their relationship began to improve as he neared adolescence, though, and in the words of his half-sister, Julia Baird: \"As he grew older, John would stay with us more often. He and Daddy got along well enough, and in the evenings when our daddy, a headwaiter, was at work, John and Mummy would sit together and listen to records. She was an Elvis Presley fan from the word go, and she and John would jive around the room to Heartbreak Hotel and other great Elvis songs. John inherited his love of music from her, and she encouraged him to start with piano and banjo, making him play a tune again and again until he got it right.\" \n\"I lost her twice,\" Lennon said. \"Once as a five-year-old when I was moved in with my auntie.

McCartney: \"We thought, 'Why not make something up?' So we got a riff going and arranged it around this riff. So that is 50-50 John and me, made up on the spot and recorded all in the same evening.\". During the session, the Beatles and the recording crew made a short trip around the corner to McCartney's house to watch the 1956 rock & roll movie The Girl Can't Help It which was being shown for the first time on British television. After the movie they returned to record \"Birthday\".\nGeorge Martin was away so his assistant Chris Thomas produced the session. His memory is that the song was mostly Paul's: \"Paul was the first one in, and he was playing the 'Birthday' riff. Eventually the others arrived, by which time Paul had literally written the song, right there in the studio.\" Everyone in the studio sang in the chorus and it was 5 am by the time the final mono mix was completed.\n\"Birthday\" begins with an intro drum fill, then moves directly into a blues progression in A (in the form of a guitar riff doubled by the bass) with McCartney singing at the top of his chest voice with Lennon on a lower harmony. After this section, a drum break lasting eight measures brings the song into the middle section, which rests entirely on the dominant. A repeat of the blues progression/guitar riff instrumental section, augmented by piano brings the song into a bridge before returning to a repeat of the first vocal section.

They are also ripe with references to pop culture (containing a reference to Bob Dylan's \"Ballad of a Thin Man\") and cosmology, and were possibly symbolic of Lennon's well-documented battles with his psychological demons. Lennon said in a Rolling Stone interview that he used the humorous title as something of a defence mechanism, so that if anyone criticised the song, he could write it off as a parody; otherwise he claimed to be sincere about the song's content. In the original demo of the song, Lennon sings \"I feel so insecure [as opposed to \"suicidal\"], just like Dylan's Mr. Jones\".\n\"Yer Blues\" was recorded in EMI Studio Two's \"annexe\", which was actually a large closet in the control room. In interviews for the Beatles Anthology series, Ringo Starr affectionately recalls recording this song in the stripped-down conditions, saying it was like the old days of live performances by The Beatles. The stripped-down, bluesy nature of the song bears similarity to much of Lennon's early solo output, including \"Cold Turkey\" and his 1970 John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band album and marks a retreat from Lennon's concern with studio experimentation that marked such songs as \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" and \"Strawberry Fields Forever\".\nJust after the album The Beatles came out in late 1968, Lennon performed \"Yer Blues\" at The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus with a supergroup dubbed the \"The Dirty Mac\", consisting of himself, Eric Clapton on lead guitar, Keith Richards on bass, and Mitch Mitchell on drums. The performance was followed with a boogie instrumental jam called \"Whole Lotta Yoko\", featuring dissonant avant-garde violinist Ivry Gitlis and vocals by Yoko Ono. The recording was never broadcast, and for decades the performance was only available on bootleg, but it finally came out officially on both CD and video in 1996.

In a special stand-alone issue, Rolling Stone ranked \"Helter Skelter\" fifty-second on its \"100 Greatest Beatles songs\" list.\nMcCartney was inspired to write the song after reading a 1967 Guitar Player magazine interview with the Who's Pete Townshend where he described their latest single, \"I Can See for Miles\", as the loudest, rawest, dirtiest song the Who had ever recorded. McCartney then \"wrote 'Helter Skelter' to be the most raucous vocal, the loudest drums, et cetera\" and said he was \"using the symbol of a helter skelter as a ride from the top to the bottom; the rise and fall of the Roman Empire—and this was the fall, the demise.\" In British English, the term \"helter-skelter\" not only has its meaning of \"in disorderly haste or confusion\" but is the name of a spiralling amusement park slide. McCartney has used this song as a response to critics who accuse him of only writing ballads.\nOn 20 November 1968, two days before the release of The Beatles, McCartney gave Radio Luxembourg an exclusive interview, in which he commented on several of the album’s songs. Speaking of \"Helter Skelter\", he said: \"Umm, that came about just 'cause I'd read a review of a record which said, 'and this group really got us wild, there's echo on everything, they're screaming their heads off.' And I just remember thinking, 'Oh, it'd be great to do one. Pity they've done it. Must be great — really screaming record.' And then I heard their record and it was quite straight, and it was very sort of sophisticated. It wasn't rough and screaming and tape echo at all. So I thought, 'Oh well, we'll do one like that, then.' And I had this song called \"Helter Skelter,\" which is just a ridiculous song. So we did it like that, 'cuz I like noise.\"\nThe song was recorded many times during sessions for The White Album. During the 18 July 1968 sessions, the Beatles recorded a version of the song lasting 27 minutes and 11 seconds, although this version is rather slow and hypnotic, differing greatly from the volume and rawness of the album version. Another recording from the same day, originally 12 minutes long, was edited down to 4:37 for Anthology 3. On 9 September, 18 takes of approximately five minutes each were recorded, and the last one is featured on the original LP. After the 18th take, Ringo Starr flung his drum sticks across the studio and screamed, \"I got blisters on me fingers!\" Included on the stereo mix of the song is Starr's shout at around 3:40, the song almost fades out, then quickly fades back in with three cymbal crashes and Ringo's scream (some sources erroneously credit the \"blisters\" line to Lennon; in fact, Lennon can be heard asking \"How's that?\" before Ringo's outburst). The mono version (originally on LP only) ends on the first fadeout without Ringo's outburst. The mono version was not initially available in the US as mono albums had already been phased out there. The mono version was later released in the American version of the Rarities album. In 2009, it was made available on the CD mono re-issue of the White Album as part of the Beatles in Mono CD box set.",Personnel = "Paul McCartney – lead vocal, lead guitar\nJohn Lennon – backing vocal, six-string bass, sound effects (through brass instruments)\nGeorge Harrison – backing vocal, rhythm guitar, sound effects\nRingo Starr – drums\nMal Evans – trumpet  ", Image1 = "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/TheBeatles68LP.jpg/220px-TheBeatles68LP.jpg" ,AudioSrc = "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/71957094/06%20-%20Helter%20Skelter.mp3" });

Ian MacDonald also argues that the song is Harrison's \"finest moment\" on The Beatles.\n\"Long, Long, Long\" is a love song, though as Nicholas Schaffner notes, it was \"the first of dozens of Harrison love songs that are ambiguous in that he could be singing either to his lady or to his Lord\". This ambiguity became more prevalent during Harrison's solo career.\nAccording to Harrison's autobiography, I, Me, Mine, the rattling heard at the end of the song was the result of a bottle of Blue Nun wine sitting on the Leslie speaker. When Paul McCartney played a certain note on the Hammond organ, the bottle began to rattle. To compound the sound, Ringo Starr recorded a fast snare drum roll.\nUnder the working title \"It's Been a Long, Long, Long Time\", recording for the song began on 7 October 1968.

When the single version was released in August, the political left viewed it as betraying their cause. The release of the album version in November indicated Lennon's uncertainty about destructive change, with the phrase \"count me out\" recorded differently as \"count me out, in\". In 1987, the song became the first Beatles recording to be licensed for a television commercial, which prompted a lawsuit from the surviving members of the group.\nIn early 1968, media coverage in the aftermath of the Tet Offensive spurred increased protests in opposition to the Vietnam War, especially among university students. The protests were most prevalent in the US, but on 17 March several thousand demonstrators marched to the American embassy in London's Grosvenor Square and violently clashed with police. Major protests concerning other political issues made international news, such as the March 1968 protests in Poland against their communist government, and the campus uprisings of May 1968 in France.\nThe Beatles had avoided expressing political viewpoints, with \"Taxman\" being their only prior song with an overt political topic. During his time in Rishikesh, Lennon decided to write a song about the recent wave of social upheaval. He recalled, \"I thought it was about time we spoke about it [revolution], the same as I thought it was about time we stopped not answering about the Vietnamese war. I had been thinking about it up in the hills in India.\"\nDespite Lennon's antiwar feelings, he had yet to become anti-establishment, and expressed in \"Revolution\" that he wanted \"to see the plan\" from those advocating toppling the system. The repeated phrase \"it's gonna be alright\" in \"Revolution\" came directly from Lennon's Transcendental Meditation experiences in India, conveying the idea that God would take care of the human race no matter what happened politically. Another influence on Lennon was his burgeoning relationship with avant-garde artist Yoko Ono; Ono attended the recording sessions, and participated in the unused portion of \"Revolution 1\" which evolved into \"Revolution 9\".\n\"Revolution 1\" has a blues style, performed at a relaxed tempo. The basic time signature is 12/8 (or 4/4 with a swing feel), but the song has several extra half-length bars during the verses. There is also an extra beat at the end of the last chorus, the result of an accidental bad edit during the mixing process that was left uncorrected at Lennon's request.\nLennon soon decided to divide the existing ten-minute recording into two parts: a more conventional Beatles track and an avant-garde sound collage. Within days after take 20, work began on \"Revolution 9\" using the last six minutes of the take as a starting point. Numerous sound effects, tape loops, and overdubs were recorded and compiled over several sessions almost exclusively by Lennon and Ono, although Harrison provided assistance for additional spoken overdubs. With more than 40 sources used for \"Revolution 9\", only small portions of the take 20 coda are heard in the final mix; most prominent from take 20 are Lennon's multiple screams of \"right\" and \"alright\", and about a minute near the end featuring Ono's lines up to \"you become naked\".\nLennon wanted \"Revolution 1\" to be the next Beatles single, but McCartney was reluctant to invite controversy, and argued along with Harrison that the track was too slow for a single. Lennon persisted, and rehearsals for a faster and louder re-make began on 9 July; recording started the following day.\nThe song begins with \"a startling machine-gun fuzz guitar riff\", with Lennon's and Harrison's guitars prominent throughout the track. The distinctive distorted guitar sound was achieved by direct injection of the guitar signal into the mixing console. Emerick further explained that he routed the signal through two microphone preamplifiers in series while he kept the amount of overload just below the point of overheating the console. McCartney overdubbed the opening scream, and Lennon double-tracked some of the words \"so roughly that its careless spontaneity becomes a point in itself\".",Personnel = "John Lennon – lead vocal, acoustic guitar, lead guitar\n Paul McCartney – bass guitar, piano, organ, backing vocals\n George Harrison – lead guitar, backing vocals\nRingo Starr – drums\n Derek Watkins and Freddy Clayton – trumpets \nDon Lang, Rex Morris, J.

These were further manipulated with echo, distortion, stereo panning, and fading.\n\"Revolution 9\" was not the first venture by the Beatles into experimental recordings. In January 1967, McCartney led the group in recording an unreleased piece called \"Carnival of Light\" during a session for \"Penny Lane\". McCartney said the work was inspired by composers Stockhausen and John Cage. Stockhausen was also a favourite of Lennon, and was one of the people included on the Sgt. Pepper album cover. Music critic Ian McDonald wrote that \"Revolution 9\" may have been influenced by Stockhausen's Hymnen in particular.\nAnother influence on Lennon was his relationship with Ono. Lennon and Ono had recently recorded their own avant-garde album, Unfinished Music No.1: Two Virgins. Lennon said: \"Once I heard her stuff—not just the screeching and howling but her sort of word pieces and talking and breathing and all this strange stuff ... I got intrigued, so I wanted to do one.\" Ono attended the recording sessions and helped Lennon select which tape loops to use.\nLennon soon decided to make the first part of the recording into a conventional Beatles' song, \"Revolution 1\", while using the last six minutes as the basis for a separate track, \"Revolution 9\". He began preparing additional sound effects and tape loops: some newly recorded in the studio, at home and from the studio archives. The work culminated on 20 June, with Lennon performing a live mix from tape loops running on machines in all three studios at Abbey Road. Additional prose was overdubbed by Lennon and Harrison\nThe piece begins with a slow piano theme in the key of B minor and a male voice repeating the words \"number nine\", quickly panning across the stereo channels. The unidentified voice was found on an EMI examination tape in the studio archives. Lennon recalled: \"I just liked the way he said 'number nine' so I made a loop ... it was like a joke, bringing number nine in it all the time ...\" Both the piano theme and the \"number nine\" loop recur many times during the piece, serving as a motif.\nMuch of the track consists of tape loops that are faded in and out, several of which are sampled from performances of classical music. Works that have been specifically identified include the Vaughan Williams motet O Clap Your Hands, the final chord from Sibelius' Symphony No. 7, and the reversed finale of Schumann's Symphonic Studies. Other loops include brief portions of Beethoven's Choral Fantasy, \"The Streets of Cairo\", violins from \"A Day in the Life\", and George Martin saying \"Geoff, put the red light on\". There are also loops of unidentified operatic performances, backwards mellotron, violins and sound effects, an oboe/horn duet, a reversed electric guitar in the key of E major, and a reversed string quartet in the key of E-flat major.\nPortions of the unused coda of \"Revolution 1\" can be heard briefly several times during the track, particularly Lennon's screams of \"right\" and \"alright\", with a longer portion near the end featuring Ono's discourse about becoming naked. Segments of random prose read by Lennon and Harrison are heard prominently throughout, along with numerous sound effects such as laughter, crowd noise, breaking glass, car horns, and gunfire. Some of the sounds were taken from an Elektra Records album of stock sound effects. The piece ends with a recording of American football chants (\"Hold that line! Block that kick!\").

I was thinking of it as a song for Ringo, which it eventually turned out to be, so I wrote it as not too rangey in the vocal, then started making a story, sort of an ancient mariner, telling the young kids where he'd lived. It was pretty much my song as I recall... I think John helped out. The lyrics got more and more obscure as it goes on, but the chorus, melody and verses are mine.\" The song began as being about different coloured submarines, but evolved to include only a yellow one.\nIn 1980, Lennon talked about the song: \"'Yellow Submarine' is Paul's baby. Donovan helped with the lyrics. I helped with the lyrics too. We virtually made the track come alive in the studio, but based on Paul's inspiration. Paul's idea. Paul's title... written for Ringo.\" Donovan added the words, \"Sky of blue and sea of green\". McCartney also said: \"It's a happy place, that's all. You know, it was just... We were trying to write a children's song. That was the basic idea. And there's nothing more to be read into it than there is in the lyrics of any children's song.\"\nLennon blew through a straw into a pan of water to create a bubbling effect, McCartney and Lennon talked through tin cans to create the sound of the captain's orders, at 1:38-40 in the song, Ringo stepped outside the doors of the recording room and yelled like a sailor acknowledging \"Cut the cable! Drop the cable!\", which was looped into the song afterwards, and Abbey Road employees John Skinner and Terry Condon twirled chains in a tin bath to create water sounds. After the line, \"and the band begins to play\", Emerick found a recording of a brass band and changed it slightly so it could not be identified, although it is thought to be a recording of Georges Krier and Charles Helmer's 1906 composition, \"Le Rêve Passe\". The original recording had a spoken intro by Starr, but the idea was abandoned on 3 June 1966.\nAlthough intended as a nonsense song for children, \"Yellow Submarine\" received various social and political interpretations at the time; music journalist Peter Doggett wrote that the \"culturally empty\" song \"became a kind of Rorschach test for radical minds.\" The song's chorus was reappropriated by schoolchildren, sports fans, and striking workers in their own chants. At a Mobe protest in San Francisco, a yellow papier-mâché submarine made its way through the crowd, which Time magazine interpreted as a \"symbol of the psychedelic set's desire for escape\". American poet Amiri Baraka criticized the song as an arrogant, solipsistic boast of White people's isolation from the real world. A reviewer for the P.O. Frisco wrote in 1966, \"the Yellow Submarine may suggest, in the context of the Beatles' anti-Vietnam War statement in Tokyo this year, that the society over which Old Glory floats is as isolated and morally irresponsible as a nuclear submarine.\" Writing for Esquire, Robert Christgau felt that the Beatles \"want their meanings to be absorbed on an instinctual level\" and wrote of the interpretations, \"I can't believe that the Beatles indulge in the simplistic kind of symbolism that turns a yellow submarine into a Nembutal or a banana—it is just a yellow submarine, damn it, an obvious elaboration of John [Lennon]'s submarine fixation, first revealed in A Hard Day's Night.\"", Personnel = "Ringo Starr – Lead vocals, drums\n    Paul McCartney – backing vocal, shouting, bass\n  John Lennon – backing vocal, shouting, acoustic guitar\nGeorge Harrison – backing vocal, tambourine\n  Mal Evans – backing vocal, bass drum \n   George Martin – backing vocal, producer\n Geoff Emerick – backing vocal, engineer \n   Neil Aspinall – backing vocal \n  Alf Bicknell – sound effects (rattling chains)\n  Pattie Boyd – backing vocal \n   Marianne Faithfull – backing vocal\n Brian Jones – backing vocal, sound effects (clinking glasses) ", Image1 = "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ac/TheBeatles-YellowSubmarinealbumcover.jpg/220px-TheBeatles-YellowSubmarinealbumcover.jpg", AudioSrc = "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/71957094/01%20-%20Yellow%20Submarine.mp3" });

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band but was omitted from that album. It was first featured in the Beatles' 1968 animated movie Yellow Submarine and appeared on its soundtrack album, released early the following year.\n\"Only a Northern Song\" has been described as Harrison's \"personal denunciation of the Beatles' music publishing business\".\nThe song's basic track was recorded on 13 February 1967, with overdubs added on 14 February and 20 April, during the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band sessions. It was recorded using two 4-track tape machines, allowing seven tracks for the complex arrangement of the song (and one for a pulse to synchronize the two machines), a method not common at the time in recording at Abbey Road. However, problems arose to getting both 4-track machines to begin playback at exactly the same time, causing difficulties mixing in stereo. \nHarrison himself described the song as \"a joke relating to Liverpool, Holy City in the North of England. In addition the song was copyrighted to Northern Songs Ltd. which I didn't own.\"\nNorthern Songs was a music publishing company formed in 1963 primarily to exploit Lennon–McCartney compositions. The company had subsequently been floated in 1965, but while Lennon and McCartney each owned 15% of the public company's shares, Harrison owned just 0.8%. Harrison was contracted by Northern Songs as a songwriter only, and because Northern Songs retained the copyright of its published songs, this meant \"Lennon and McCartney, as major shareholders, would earn more from his [Harrison's] songs than him.\"\nHence the song's \"mild dissonance\" and \"nasally sarcastic\" key-changes have been said to complement the \"suppressed bitterness\" of Harrison's lyric, which features such self-referential lines as: \"It doesn't really matter what chords I play/What words I say or time of day it is/As it's only a Northern Song.\"\nAs well as reflecting Harrison's dissatisfaction with Northern Songs, and its major shareholder Dick James in particular – \"I was starting to get a bit of an idea that ... you'd only written half a song and he [James] would be trying to assign it\" – the song also suggests that, at this time, Harrison \"had yet to recover his enthusiasm for being a Beatle\", having threatened to leave the group six months earlier, following their final live concert at Candlestick Park.",Personnel = "George Harrison – vocal, organ, tape effects, noises\nJohn Lennon – piano, glockenspiel, tape effects, noises\nPaul McCartney – bass guitar, trumpet, tape effects, noises\nRingo Starr – drums  ", Image1 = "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ac/TheBeatles-YellowSubmarinealbumcover.jpg/220px-TheBeatles-YellowSubmarinealbumcover.jpg" ,AudioSrc = "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/71957094/02%20-%20Only%20A%20Northern%20Song.mp3" });

During the recording, McCartney started to bark without warning. The next lines, initially written as \"Hey bullfrog\" by Lennon, were changed mid-song to \"Hey bulldog\", which would become the song's title.\nGeoff Emerick, the Beatles' engineer, would subsequently claim this was the last song the band recorded that featured a team dynamic with enthusiasm from every member. He also praised the performance in his book Here, There, Everywhere, saying \"Paul's bass line was probably the most inventive of any he'd done since Pepper, and it was really well played. Harrison's solo was sparkling, too--one of the few times that he nailed it right away. His amp was turned up really loud, and he used one of his new fuzz boxes, which made his guitar absolutely scream.\" When the group reconvened in the studio in May 1968 for the The Beatles sessions, their group cohesion had already been undermined by the business, artistic, and personal differences that would culminate in their eventual break-up.\nThe song was used in a segment of the animated film Yellow Submarine. Initially it appeared only in some European theatrical prints. It was cut from the American version by the movie's producer Al Brodax as he and the group felt the film was too long. It was restored for the film's 1999 re-release. To promote the reissue, Apple went back to the original footage shot for the \"Lady Madonna\" promo film and restructured it for use as a promotional clip for \"Hey Bulldog\" (as it is possible to identify what they were playing, and therefore possible to synchronise the music with the original footage).\nThe guitar riff from \"Hey Bulldog\" was included in the 2006 album Love in its version of \"Lady Madonna\", but in a different key (from the key of B minor to A major). Some of Lennon and McCartney laughing was featured in the \"Blue Jay Way\" transitional piece.\nMcCartney spoke fondly of \"Hey Bulldog\" in 1994: \"I remember (it) as being one of John's songs and I helped him finish it off in the studio, but it's mainly his vibe. There's a little rap at the end between John and I, we went into a crazy little thing at the end.

Such movement characterises many of Harrison's other spiritually oriented Beatles songs such as \"Long, Long, Long\"  and \"The Inner Light\". There may be a connection between this musical constancy of the tonic and the song's lyrics such as \"It's all too much for me to see, a love that's shining all around here. The more I am, the less I know, and what I do is all too much\" and Pollack states that the refrain appears to utilize IV (C major) ii minor (Am) chords but insists \"there is no root chord change anywhere in this section; that it all boils down to neighbour tone motion in the inner voices superimposed on to the pedal tone of G in the bass.\"  The song contains several lines taken from other works. The line \"With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue\" was lifted from the McCoys' \"Sorrow\", and at one point the trumpets seem to emulate Jeremiah Clarke's \"Prince of Denmark's March\".\nThe song was recorded at De Lane Lea Studios, 129 Kingsway, making it one of only a very few tracks by the Beatles that were not recorded at EMI Studios. Harrison and John Lennon played both lead and rhythmn guitars on the song. Other than their earlier hit \"I Feel Fine\", this was the only other Beatles' track to use feedback extensively.

When asked in 1971 whether songs like \"Give Peace a Chance\" and \"Power to the People\" were propaganda songs, he answered: 'Sure. So was All You Need Is Love. I'm a revolutionary artist. My art is dedicated to change.'\"\nThe day before the Our World broadcast, the Beatles decided that the song should be their next single. Released in the UK on 7 July 1967, it went straight to number one and remained there for three weeks. It was similarly successful in the United States after its release on 17 July, reaching number one for a week. It was also included on the American LP version of Magical Mystery Tour in November as well as in the film, and on the LP Yellow Submarine, released in 1969. This song is also featured in the Cirque du Soleil's show \"Love\", based on the songs of The Beatles, which has been performing in Las Vegas since 2006.\nFor the broadcast, the Beatles were (except for Starr) seated on stools, accompanied by a small studio orchestra. They were surrounded by friends and acquaintances seated on the floor, many of whom were among the leading stars of the British pop scene, who sang with the refrain during the fade-out.\nLennon, affecting indifference, was said to be nervous about the broadcast, given the potential size of the international TV audience. Dissatisfied with his singing, he re-recorded the solo verses for use on the single. Starr also overdubbed drums before the single was released, fixing the aforementioned timing problems and adding the drum roll.\nThe programme was broadcast in 'black-and-white' (colour television had yet to commence broadcasting in Britain and most of the world).

It has been speculated that each verse refers cryptically to each of the Beatles (e.g. \"he's one holy roller\" allegedly refers to the spiritually inclined George Harrison; \"he got monkey finger, he shoot Coca-Cola\" to Ringo Starr, the funny Beatle; \"he got Ono sideboard, he one spinal cracker\" to Lennon himself; and \"got to be good-looking 'cause he's so hard to see\" to Paul McCartney); however, it has also been suggested that the song has only a single \"pariah-like protagonist\" and Lennon was \"painting another sardonic self-portrait\"\nJohn Lennon played rhythm guitar and sang the vocal; Paul McCartney played bass; Ringo Starr played drums; and George Harrison played lead guitar. It was produced by George Martin and recorded at the end of July 1969 at Abbey Road Studios. In the intro, Lennon says \"shoot me\" which is accompanied by his handclaps and McCartney's heavy bass riff. The famous Beatles' \"walrus\" from \"I Am the Walrus\" and \"Glass Onion\" returns in the line \"he got walrus gumboot\", followed by \"he got Ono sideboard\". Bluesman Muddy Waters is also mentioned in the song.\nAlthough McCartney composed the electric piano part, Lennon looked over his shoulder to learn it so he could perform it himself on the recording. Music critic Ian MacDonald reports that McCartney sang a backing vocal, but recording engineer Geoff Emerick said that Lennon did all the vocals himself.\nThis classic 1960s rock anthem with deep bluesy style was unlike any other song of its time in that it was constructed entirely of verse/refrains. There is no chorus and only one short guitar solo, acting as a bridge to interrupt the radical song structure. For the first eight bars, the tonic note D is repeated, eventually moving to the V chord and then to the IV chord. It then moves to the VI minor chord, which is a progression rarely used, the song \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\" being a rare example. The refrain in actuality is three bars long, because the melody keeps going after the last A5 chord and comes to rest on the D5 chord after that. F# is introduced in the melody with a B minor triad.

As well as critical acclaim, the single achieved commercial success, topping the Billboard charts in the United States and making the top five in the United Kingdom. The song has been covered by over 150 artists, making it the second-most covered Beatles song after \"Yesterday\". Artists who have covered the song include Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles, James Brown, Shirley Bassey, Tony Bennett, Ike & Tina Turner, the Miracles, Eric Clapton, Joe Cocker, Isaac Hayes, Julio Iglesias, Mina and Phish.\nDuring the 1968 recording sessions for The Beatles (also referred to as the White Album), Harrison began working on a song that eventually became known as \"Something\". The song's first lyrics were adapted from the title of an unrelated song by fellow Apple artist James Taylor called \"Something in the Way She Moves\" and used as filler while the melody was being developed. The song's second line, \"Attracts me like no other lover,\" was the last to be written; during early recording sessions for \"Something\", Harrison alternated between two placeholder lyrics: \"Attracts me like a cauliflower\" and \"Attracts me like a pomegranate.\"\nHarrison later said that \"I had a break while Paul was doing some overdubbing so I went into an empty studio and began to write. That's really all there is to it, except the middle took some time to sort out. It didn't go on the White Album because we'd already finished all the tracks.\" A demo recording of the song by Harrison from this period appears on the Anthology 3 collection, released in 1996.\nMany believe that Harrison's inspiration for \"Something\" was his wife at the time, Pattie Boyd. Boyd also claimed that inspiration in her 2007 autobiography, Wonderful Tonight, where she wrote: \"He told me, in a matter-of-fact way, that he had written it for me.\"\nHowever, Harrison has cited other sources of inspiration to the contrary. In a 1996 interview he responded to the question of whether the song was about Pattie: \"Well no, I didn't [write it about her]. I just wrote it, and then somebody put together a video. And what they did was they went out and got some footage of me and Pattie, Paul and Linda, Ringo and Maureen, it was at that time, and John and Yoko and they just made up a little video to go with it. So then, everybody presumed I wrote it about Pattie, but actually, when I wrote it, I was thinking of Ray Charles.\"\n\"Something\" was recorded during the Abbey Road sessions. It took 52 takes in two main periods, the first session involved a demo take on Harrison's 26th birthday (featured on Anthology 3), 25 February 1969, followed by 13 backing track takes on 16 April. The second main session took 39 takes and started on 2 May 1969 when the main parts of the song were laid down in 36 takes, finishing on 15 August 1969 after several days of recording overdubs.\nThe original draft that the Beatles used lasted eight minutes, with an extended coda with Lennon on the piano. The middle also contained a small counter-melody section in the draft. Both the counter-melody and Lennon's piano piece were cut from the final version. Still, Lennon's piano was not erased totally. Some bits can be heard in the middle eight, in particular the line played downwards on the C major scale, i.e. the connecting passage to Harrison's guitar solo. The erased parts of Lennon's piano section is similar to the style on Lennon's song \"Remember\".\nAlthough Harrison himself had been dismissive of the song—he later said that he \"put it on ice for about six months because I thought 'that's too easy'\"—Lennon and McCartney both stated that they held \"Something\" in high regard. Lennon said \"I think that's about the best track on the album, actually\", while McCartney said \"For me I think it's the best he's written.\" Both had largely ignored Harrison's compositions prior to \"Something\", with their own songs taking much of the limelight.",Personnel = "George Harrison – lead vocal, lead and rhythm guitars\n Paul McCartney – bass guitar, backing vocal\n  John Lennon – piano\n Ringo Starr – drums  ", Image1 = "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/42/Beatles_-_Abbey_Road.jpg/220px-Beatles_-_Abbey_Road.jpg" ,AudioSrc = "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/71957094/02%20-%20Something.mp3" });

It was rehearsed again three months later, in January 1969, at Twickenham film studios during the Get Back sessions but would not be recorded for another six months.\nBeatles guitarist George Harrison described the song in 1969 as \"one of those instant whistle-along tunes which some people hate, and other people really like. It's a fun song, but it's kind of a drag because Maxwell keeps on destroying everyone like his girlfriend then the school teacher, and then, finally, the judge.\"\nIn 1994, McCartney said that the song merely epitomises the downfalls of life, being \"my analogy for when something goes wrong out of the blue, as it so often does, as I was beginning to find out at that time in my life. I wanted something symbolic of that, so to me it was some fictitious character called Maxwell with a silver hammer. I don't know why it was silver, it just sounded better than Maxwell's hammer. It was needed for scanning. We still use that expression now when something unexpected happens.\"\nRecording began at Abbey Road Studios on 9 July 1969. John Lennon, who had been absent from recording sessions for the previous eight days after being injured in a car crash, arrived to work on the song, accompanied by his wife, Yoko Ono, who, more badly hurt in the accident than Lennon, lay on a large double-bed in the studio. Sixteen takes of the rhythm track were made, followed by a series of guitar overdubs. The unused fifth take can be heard on Anthology 3. Over the following two days the group overdubbed vocals, piano, Hammond organ, anvil, and guitar. The song was completed on 6 August, when McCartney recorded a solo on a Moog synthesizer.\nThe recording subsequently drew comment from the band: Lennon said \"I was ill after the accident when they did most of that track, and it really ground George and Ringo into the ground recording it\", adding later \"I hate it, 'cos all I remember is the track ... [Paul] did everything to make it into a single, and it never was and it never could have been.\" Harrison characterised the song as \"fruity\" and commented \"we spent a hell of a lot of time on it\", and later \"after a while, we did a good job on it\". McCartney recalled: \"The only arguments were about things like me spending three days on Maxwell's Silver Hammer. I remember George saying, 'You've taken three days, it's only a song.' – 'Yeah, but I want to get it right. I've got some thoughts on this one.'

The song and the following improvisation are included on the Anthology 3 CD.\nThe basic track was recorded on 20 April 1969, but there were many overdub sessions, including multiple attempts at the lead vocal by McCartney (as described above).

The song was rehearsed several times during the Get Back/Let It Be sessions; the basic track and Lennon's guide vocal (which is used in the master) were recorded at Trident Studios on 22 February 1969, shortly after filming for the film ended. Lennon played the lead guitar, as George Harrison stated:\n\"It's very heavy. John plays lead guitar and sings the same as he plays. It's really basically a bit like a blues. The riff that he sings and plays is really a very basic blues-type thing. But again, it's very original sort of John-type song.\"\nLennon and Harrison overdubbed multi-tracked heavy guitars on 18 April 1969. Billy Preston's keyboards and Ringo Starr's congas were added on 20 April 1969. \"I Want You\" received the \"She's So Heavy\" vocals on 11 August, and thus the title became \"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\". \"'She's So Heavy' was about Yoko,\" Lennon told Rolling Stone. \"When you're drowning, you don't say, 'I would be incredibly pleased if someone would have the foresight to notice me drowning and come and help me.' You just scream.\"\nThree takes from 22 February were edited into a master (second generation), which was overdubbed, mixed down on 18 April (third generation), and overdubbed on 18 April, 20 April and 11 August.

The mix is the third generation for 4:37 and then the second generation tape, which has white noise produced by the Moog synthesizer played by Lennon and additional drums added on 8 August. The overdub session for \"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\" was the last time all four Beatles worked in the studio together.\nThe final master lasted 8:04, but Lennon decided on a surprise ending.

Anyway, it seems as if winter in England goes on forever, by the time spring comes you really deserve it. So one day I decided I was going to sag off Apple and I went over to Eric Clapton's house. The relief of not having to go see all those dopey accountants was wonderful, and I walked around the garden with one of Eric's acoustic guitars and wrote \"Here Comes the Sun\".\nHarrison, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr recorded the rhythm track in 13 takes on 7 July 1969. John Lennon did not contribute to the song as he was recovering from a car crash. Towards the end of the session Harrison spent an hour re-recording his acoustic guitar part. He capoed his guitar on the 7th fret, resulting in the final key of A major (in fact, slightly above A major due to the track being varispeeded by less than a semitone). He also used the same technique on his 1965 song \"If I Needed Someone\", which shares a similar melodic pattern. The following day he taped his lead vocals, and he and McCartney recorded their backing vocals twice to give a fuller sound.\nA harmonium and handclaps were added on 16 July. Harrison added an electric guitar run through a Leslie speaker on 6 August, and the orchestral parts (Martin's score for two piccolos, two flutes, two alto flutes and two clarinets) were added on 15 August. \"Here Comes the Sun\" was completed four days later with the addition of Harrison's Moog synthesizer part.\nAstronomer and science popularizer Carl Sagan had wanted the song to be included on the Voyager Golden Record, copies of which were attached to both spacecraft of the Voyager program to provide any entity that recovered them a representative sample of human civilization.

It appears in what Alan Pollack refers to as the \"mini-bridge\", and then again at the end of the song. The group were among the first in contemporary rock and roll to experiment with a Moog, though the instrument had been used before.\nAccording to Lennon, the song's close musical resemblance to Ludwig van Beethoven's \"Moonlight Sonata\" was no coincidence: \"Yoko was playing Beethoven's 'Moonlight Sonata' on the piano ... I said, 'Can you play those chords backwards?', and wrote 'Because' around them. The lyrics speak for themselves ... No imagery, no obscure references.\"\nThe main recording session for \"Because\" was on 1 August 1969, with vocal overdubs on 4 August, and a double-tracked Moog synthesiser overdub by Harrison on 5 August.

The working title was \"Here Comes the Sun King\", but was shortened to \"Sun King\" to avoid confusion with Harrison's \"Here Comes the Sun\". The song slowly fades in from the swamp sounds at the end of \"You Never Give Me Your Money\". At the end of the song, the music stops abruptly and a drum fill by Ringo Starr leads into the next track, \"Mean Mr. Mustard\".\nThe faux mixing of Romance languages occurs in the last three lines of the song. In 1969, Lennon was interviewed about these lyrics and said, \"We just started joking, you know, singing 'cuando para mucho.' So we just made up... Paul knew a few Spanish words from school, you know. So we just strung any Spanish words that sounded vaguely like something. And of course we got 'chicka ferdy' in. That's a Liverpool expression. Just like sort – it doesn't mean anything to me but (childish taunting) 'na-na, na-na-na!'\"\nAnother noted aspect of the song is its use of cross-channel phasing, or stereo panning and fading. The lead guitar line slowly moves from the right to left channel and then back. This occurs in the beginning of the song, and then again at the end. In an interview in 1987, Harrison said that the recording was inspired by Fleetwood Mac's \"Albatross\". \"At the time, 'Albatross' (by Fleetwood Mac) was out, with all the reverb on guitar. So we said, 'Let's be Fleetwood Mac doing Albatross, just to get going.' It never really sounded like Fleetwood Mac... but that was the point of origin.\"\nA portion of the vocals was included as a reversed a cappella in the track titled \"Gnik Nus\" for the 2006 album Love.

It appears on Anthology 3. In this version, Mustard's sister is named Shirley. Lennon changed it to Pam when he saw the opportunity to ease the segue into the song \"Polythene Pam\", which follows \"Mean Mr. Mustard\" on the album. According to Lennon, \"In 'Mean Mr. Mustard', I said 'his sister Pam'—originally it was 'his sister Shirley' in the lyric. I changed it to Pam to make it sound like it had something to do with it.\" Additionally, the original version of the song was a quieter acoustic rendition and was over 4 minutes in length.\nAs eventually recorded, \"Mustard\" originally was to end in the chord of D major—this would have led into the next track in the climactic medley, \"Her Majesty\". However, since the latter song was moved to the end of the album, \"Mustard\" instead hard-edits into \"Polythene Pam\", and thus the final note of \"Mustard\" would open \"Her Majesty\" as a stand-alone track at the album's conclusion.

Lennon would describe this song, along with \"Mean Mr. Mustard\", in The Beatles Anthology as \"a bit of crap I wrote in India\".\nIn 1980, John Lennon said about \"Polythene Pam\": \"That was me, remembering a little event with a woman in Jersey, and a man who was England's answer to Allen Ginsberg...I met him when we were on tour and he took me back to his apartment and I had a girl and he had one he wanted me to meet. He said she dressed up in polythene, which she did. She didn't wear jack boots and kilts, I just sort of elaborated. Perverted sex in a polythene bag. Just looking for something to write about.\" The song is sung in a very strong Liverpudlian \"Scouse\" accent.\nPolythene is a British variant of the word polyethylene, a plastic material. The name 'Polythene Pam' came from the nickname of an early Beatles' fan from the Cavern Club days, named Pat Hodgett (now Dawson), who would often eat polythene. She became known as 'Polythene Pat'. She said in an interview, \"I used to eat polythene all the time. I'd tie it in knots and then eat it. Sometimes I even used to burn it and then eat it when it got cold.\"\nOn the album Abbey Road, the song is linked with the previous song \"Mean Mr. Mustard\" musically, as the two run together without pause. The two songs are also linked narratively, since \"Mean Mr. Mustard\" mentions that the title character Mustard has a sister named Pam. Originally, the line \"his sister Pam...\" in the song was \"his sister Shirley...\", but Lennon would change the line to contribute to the continuity of the Abbey Road side two medley. The song \"Her Majesty\" was originally set between \"Mean Mr. Mustard\" and \"Polythene Pam\". \"Polythene Pam\" then segues into the following song, \"She Came in Through the Bathroom Window\".\nAt 0:47, someone picks up a tambourine and, in the left channel, Paul McCartney can be heard saying \"Yeah,\" while Lennon says, \"Great\". Compositionally, \"Polythene Pam\" ends with the final notes of the guitar solo, at which point Lennon says, \"We'll listen to that now.\" Lennon laughs, followed by \"Oh, look out!\" and a sudden, nearly-inaudible \"You should...\" before the transition.

Jessica Samuels, one of the group, says: \"We were bored, he was out and so we decided to pay him a visit. We found a ladder in his garden and stuck it up at the bathroom window which he'd left slightly open. I was the one who climbed up and got in.\" She then opened the front door to let the others in, and they raided his wardrobe for a pair of trousers, which they took turns wearing. The scruffs also stole a number of photographs. Another Apple scruff, Margo Bird, remembers being good friends with McCartney – she would often take his dog for walks – and later got a job at Apple Corps. She says that she was asked to retrieve a certain photograph, which she did.\nIn the 2006 DVD documentary The Classic Artists Series: The Moody Blues (DVD UK, released October 2006), Mike Pinder, the former keyboard player of Birmingham R&B band The Moody Blues, states that the inspiration for the song actually rests with an incident that happened to them — a groupie climbing into an open bathroom window in the band's home and spending the night with band member Ray Thomas. The next day, Pinder and Thomas recounted the story to McCartney, who — guitar in hand — strummed and sang \"She came in through the bathroom window...\"\nThe rhythm track was recorded by the Beatles for this and \"Polythene Pam\" as one piece on 25 July 1969. After take 39, they added lead vocals, and re-recorded the drums and bass parts. On 28 July they added more vocals,guitar,percussion and piano.

The poem appears in Dekker's 1603 comedy Patient Grissel. McCartney saw sheet music for Dekker's lullaby at his father's home in Liverpool, left on a piano by his stepsister Ruth. Unable to read music, he created his own music. McCartney uses the first stanza of the original poem, with minor word changes, adding to it a single lyric line repeated with minor variation. Abbey Road does not credit Dekker with the stanza or with the title.\nMcCartney was the lead vocalist. He begins the song in a soft tone appropriate for a lullaby, with piano, bass guitar, and string section accompaniment. Beginning with the line \"Golden slumbers fill your eyes\", the drums come in and McCartney switches to a stronger tone, both of which emphasise the switch to the refrain. McCartney said, \"I remember trying to get a very strong vocal on it, because it was such a gentle theme, so I worked on the strength of the vocal on it, and ended up quite pleased with it.\"\nThe main recording session for \"Golden Slumbers\"/\"Carry That Weight\" was on 2 July 1969. John Lennon was not present. He was injured in a motor vehicle accident in Scotland on 1 July 1969, and was hospitalised there until 6 July.\nAdditional vocals were added in an overdub session on 30 July 1969, the same day the first trial edit of the side two medley was created.

The ending also reprises the arpeggiated guitar motif from the end of that track, similar to the figure featured prominently in the George Harrison written tracks \"Here Comes the Sun\" and \"Badge\" (co-written by Harrison and Eric Clapton). The song was written by Paul McCartney, but credited to Lennon–McCartney.\nMusic critic Ian MacDonald interpreted the lyric as an acknowledgment by the group that nothing they would do as individual artists would equal what they had achieved together, and they would always carry the weight of their Beatle past. McCartney said the song was about the Beatles' business difficulties and the atmosphere at Apple at the time. In the film Imagine: John Lennon, Lennon says that McCartney was \"singing about all of us.\"\nThe rhythm tracks featured McCartney on piano, Harrison on bass guitar and Starr on drums.

He had a line in it, 'And in the end, the love you get is equal to the love you give,' which is a very cosmic, philosophical line. Which again proves that if he wants to, he can think.\" Lennon misquoted the line; the actual words are, \"And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make.\"\nRecording began on 23 July 1969, when the Beatles recorded a one-minute, thirty-second master take that was extended via overdubs to two minutes and five seconds. At this point, the song was called \"Ending.\" The first vocals for the song were added on 5 August, additional vocals and guitar overdubs were added on 7 August, and bass and drums on 8 August, the day the Abbey Road cover picture was taken. Orchestral overdubs were added 15 August, and the closing piano and accompanying vocal on 18 August.\nAll four Beatles have a solo in \"The End\", including a Ringo Starr drum solo. Starr disliked solos; he preferred to cater drumwork to whoever sang in a particular performance. The take in which he performed the solo originally had guitar and tambourine accompaniment, but other instruments were muted during mixing giving the effect of a drum solo. The additional instruments were restored for a remix on the Anthology 3 compilation album. The drum solo was also later used at the beginning of \"Get Back\" on the 2006 album Love.\nMcCartney, Harrison, and Lennon perform a rotating sequence of three, two-bar guitar solos. The solos begin approximately 53 seconds into the song and end just before the final piano part. Lennon described it in his 1970 interview with Rolling Stone: \"There's a nice little bit I played on Abbey Road. Paul gave us each a piece, a little break where Paul plays, George plays and I play.\" The first two bars are played by McCartney, the second two by Harrison, and the third two by Lennon, then the sequence repeats. Each has a distinctive style which McCartney felt reflected their personalities: McCartney's playing included string bends similar to his lead guitar work on \"Another Girl\" from the Help! album and the stinging style he had first perfected on \"Taxman\" from Revolver; Harrison's solo incorporated the melodic yet technically advanced slides that were becoming his trademark; lastly Lennon's contribution was rhythmic, snarling, and had the heaviest distortion, echoing his lead work in \"Revolution\". Immediately after Lennon's third solo, the piano chords of the final line \"And in the end...\" begin. Then the orchestration arrangement takes over with a humming chorus and Harrison playing a final guitar solo that ends the song.\n\"The End\" was initially intended to be the final track on Abbey Road, but it is followed by \"Her Majesty\". In the first practice mix of the medley, constructed on 30 July, \"Her Majesty\" followed \"Mean Mr. Mustard\" (on the released version of the album, \"Her Majesty\" begins with the excised final chord of \"Mean Mr. Mustard\"). According to sound engineer John Kurlander, McCartney said, \"I don't like 'Her Majesty,' throw it away.\" Kurlander cut it out, but said, \"I'd been told never to throw anything away, so after he left I picked it up off the floor, put about 20 seconds of red leader tape before it, and stuck it onto the end of the edit tape.\" When McCartney heard \"Her Majesty\" in its new position he liked it and decided that it should remain on the album.",Personnel = "Paul McCartney – lead and backing vocals, bass guitar, piano, guitar solo\nGeorge Harrison – backing vocals, rhythm and lead guitar, guitar solo\nJohn Lennon – backing vocals, guitar solo\nRingo Starr – drums, backing vocals on the \"Love you\" chorus  ", Image1 = "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/42/Beatles_-_Abbey_Road.jpg/220px-Beatles_-_Abbey_Road.jpg" ,AudioSrc = "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/71957094/16%20-%20The%20End.mp3" });

He was instructed by McCartney to destroy the tape, but EMI policy stated that no Beatles recording was ever to be destroyed. The fourteen seconds of silence between \"The End\" and \"Her Majesty\" are the result of Kurlander’s lead-out tape added to separate the song from the rest of the recording.\nThe loud chord that occurs at the beginning of the song is the ending, as recorded, of \"Mean Mr. Mustard\". \"Her Majesty\" ends abruptly because its own final note was left at the beginning of \"Polythene Pam\". Paul applauded Kurlander's \"surprise effect\" and the track became the unintended closer to the LP. The crudely edited beginning and end of \"Her Majesty\" shows that it was not meant to be included in the final mix of the album; as McCartney says in The Beatles Anthology, \"Typical Beatles - an accident.\" Consequently, both of the original sides of vinyl close with a song that ends abruptly (the other being \"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\").\nAt 23-second long, \"Her Majesty\" is the shortest song in the Beatles' repertoire (contrasting the same album's \"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\", their longest song apart from \"Revolution 9\", an eight-minute avant-garde piece from The White Album). The song was not listed on the original vinyl record's sleeve as the sleeves had already been printed; subsequent pressings and the CD edition correct this.

Unsatisfied with this style, which McCartney described as \"chunky\", the band reworked the song around acoustic guitars. The Beatles performed a finished version of the song live at Apple Studios on 31 January 1969; this performance was included in both the Let It Be film and album.\nIn May 1969, McCartney produced a recording of the song using this title by the group Mortimer, a New York City trio that briefly recorded for Apple, but this recording was never released.",Personnel = "Paul McCartney – lead vocal, lead acoustic guitar – Martin D-28\n John Lennon – harmony vocal, whistling, rhythm acoustic guitar – Martin D-28\nGeorge Harrison – bassline on electric guitar – Fender Telecaster\nRingo Starr – drums  ", Image1 = "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/25/LetItBe.jpg/220px-LetItBe.jpg" ,AudioSrc = "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/71957094/01-Two%20of%20Us.mp3" });

It was written for his soon-to-be wife Yoko Ono, and featured a multitude of strange, seemingly nonsense phrases which were strung together in what Lennon refers to as a Bob Dylan style of lyric. The working title for the song, \"All I want is you\" was originally the title of another composition by Lennon for Yoko, from which the chorus was taken.\nThe song was one of the songs on Let It Be that was recorded at the rooftop concert, with an assistant holding up Lennon's lyrics for him as a cue. It begins with a false start, with Ringo Starr yelling \"Hold it!\" to halt the other band members because he was holding a cigarette and had only one drum stick in his hand.

He began to write the rest of the lyrics and when he was done, he went to bed and forgot about them.\nLennon said : \"I was lying next to my first wife in bed and I was thinking. It started off as a negative song and she must have been going on and on about something. She'd gone to sleep and I kept hearing, 'Words are flowing out like endless streams...' I was a bit irritated and I went downstairs and it turned into a sort of cosmic song rather than, 'Why are you always mouthing off at me?'... The words are purely inspirational and were given to me - except for maybe one or two where I had to resolve a line or something like that. I don't own it; it came through like that.\"\nThe flavour of the song was heavily influenced by Lennon's and the Beatles' interest in Transcendental Meditation in late 1967 – early 1968, when the song was composed. Based on this he added the mantra \"Jai guru deva om\" (Sanskrit: जय गुरुदेव ॐ) to the piece, which became the link to the chorus. The Sanskrit phrase is a sentence fragment whose words could have many meanings. Literally it approximates as \"glory to the shining remover of darkness,\" and can be paraphrased as \"Victory to God divine\", \"Hail to the divine guru\", or the phrase commonly invoked by the late Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in referring to his spiritual teacher \"All Glory to Guru Dev.\"\nIn his 1970 interview with Rolling Stone, Lennon referred to the song as perhaps the best, most poetic lyric he ever wrote: \"It's one of the best lyrics I've written. In fact, it could be the best. It's good poetry, or whatever you call it, without chewin' it. See, the ones I like are the ones that stand as words, without melody. They don't have to have any melody, like a poem, you can read them.\"\nIn February 1968, the Beatles convened at the EMI Abbey Road studios to record a single for release during their absence on their forthcoming trip to India. Paul McCartney had written \"Lady Madonna\" and Lennon, \"Across the Universe\". Both tracks were recorded along with Lennon's \"Hey Bulldog\" and the vocal track for George's \"The Inner Light\" between the 3 and 11 of February.\nLennon still wasn't satisfied with the feel of the track and several sound effects were taped, including 15 seconds of humming and a guitar and a harp-like sound, both to be played backwards; however, none of these were used on the released version. The track was mixed to mono and put aside as the group had decided to release \"Lady Madonna\" and \"The Inner Light\" as the single. On their return from India, the group set about recording the many songs they had written there, and \"Across the Universe\" remained on the shelf. In the autumn of 1968, the Beatles seriously considered releasing an EP including most of the songs for the Yellow Submarine album and \"Across the Universe\", and went as far as having the EP mastered.\nMusic critic Richie Unterberger of Allmusic said the song was \"one of the group's most delicate and cosmic ballads,\" and \"was one of the highlights of the Let It Be album.\" Music critic Ian MacDonald was critical of the song, calling it a \"plaintively babyish incantation\" and saying \"its vague pretensions and listless melody are rather too obviously the products of acid grandiosity rendered gentle by sheer exhaustion.\"\nOn 4 February 2008, at 00:00 UTC, NASA transmitted the Interstellar Message \"Across the Universe\" in the direction of the star Polaris, 431 light years from Earth. The transmission was made using a 70m antenna in the Deep Space Network's Madrid Deep Space Communication Complex, located outside of Madrid, Spain. It was done with an \"X band\" transmitter, radiating into the antenna at 18 kW. This was done to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the song's recording, the 45th anniversary of the Deep Space Network (DSN), and the 50th anniversary of NASA. The idea was hatched by Beatles historian Martin Lewis, who encouraged all Beatles fans to play the track as it was beamed to the distant star. The event marked the first time a song had ever been intentionally transmitted into deep space, and was approved by McCartney, Yoko Ono, and Apple Corps.",Personnel = "John Lennon – lead vocal, acoustic guitar, rhythm guitar\nPaul McCartney – piano\nGeorge Harrison – tambura, electric guitar\nRingo Starr – maracas, drums ", Image1 = "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/25/LetItBe.jpg/220px-LetItBe.jpg" ,AudioSrc = "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/71957094/03-Across%20the%20Universe.mp3" });

When the little 'i' merges into the big 'I' then you are really smiling!-George Harrison. \nThe set of pronouns which forms the song's title is a conventional way of referring to the ego in a Hindu context. For example, the Bhagavad Gita 2:71-72 can be translated as \"They are forever free who renounce all selfish desires and break away from the ego-cage of \"I\", \"me\" and \"mine\" to be united with the Lord. This is the supreme state. Attain to this, and pass from death to immortality.\" Perhaps subconsciously, the song also reflects Harrison's reaction to the clashes of egos in the Beatles' painful closing days as a group.\nAfter receiving his \"eternal problem\" inspiration, Harrison played some chords to the 6/8 time signature, and added a bluesy bridge. The song was inspired by the incidental music for a BBC television program, Europa—The Titled and the Untitled, which aired on 7 January 1969; Harrison wrote the song that night and performed the song for the other Beatles the following morning.\nThe song was released on the Let It Be album; however, the Beatles had not done a proper studio recording of the song during the January 1969 sessions. When director Michael Lindsay-Hogg chose to include the \"I Me Mine\" segment in the Let It Be film, the Beatles decided to record the song for inclusion on the accompanying album. Paul McCartney, Harrison and Starr met in the studio on 3 January 1970, to record the group version of the song. John Lennon was not available; he was on holiday in Denmark. Lennon had privately quit the group in September 1969 so it is not known if he would have attended anyway.\nAlthough the sessions for \"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\" and \"The End\" in August 1969 were the last where all four Beatles were present in the recording studio, \"I Me Mine\" was the last new song recorded by the Beatles, albeit without Lennon, until the \"Free as a Bird\"/\"Real Love\" reunion sessions in 1994. However, it was not their last recording session. The three returned the next day, 4 January 1970, to record overdubs on \"Let It Be\", Harrison returned on 8 January to record vocal overdubs on \"For You Blue\" and Starr returned on 1 April 1970, to record overdubs for \"Across the Universe\", \"The Long and Winding Road\" and an additional drum track for \"I Me Mine\".",Personnel = "George Harrison – lead and harmony vocal, acoustic guitar, lead guitar\nPaul McCartney – harmony vocal, bass, Hammond organ, electric piano\nRingo Starr – drums  ", Image1 = "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/25/LetItBe.jpg/220px-LetItBe.jpg" ,AudioSrc = "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/71957094/04-I%20Me%20Mine.mp3" });

The interjection actually comes from the first version, recorded on the 24th.

I felt very blessed to have that dream. So that got me writing 'Let It Be'.\" He also said in a later interview about the dream that his mother had told him \"It will be all right, just let it be.\"\nThe first rehearsal of \"Let It Be\" took place at Twickenham Film Studios on 3 January 1969, where the group had, the previous day, begun what would become the Let It Be film. During this stage of the film they were only recording on the mono decks used for syncing to the film cameras, and were not making multi-track recordings for release. A single take was recorded, with just McCartney on piano and vocals. The first attempt with the other Beatles was made on 8 January. Work continued on the song throughout the month. Multi-track recordings commenced on 23 January at Apple Studios.\nThe master take was recorded on 31 January 1969, as part of the 'Apple studio performance' for the project. McCartney played Blüthner piano, Lennon played six-string electric bass, Billy Preston played organ, and George Harrison and Ringo Starr assumed their conventional roles on guitar and drums. This was one of two performances of the song that day. The first version, designated take 27-A, would serve as the basis for all officially released versions of the song. The other version, take 27-B, was performed as part of the 'live studio performance', along with \"Two of Us\" and \"The Long and Winding Road\".

They adopt heavy scouse accents for the performance. Though the performance, which trails off after just 39 seconds and was obviously tongue-in-cheek, is truncated, the recording was included on the 1970 album drawn from those sessions, Let It Be, appearing immediately after the title song.\nThe version they performed was spelt \"Maggie Mae\" on the track listing and all four Beatles were credited as arrangers of the traditional song, thus allowing them to collect the writers' share of the publishing income for this public domain song. The song had been a staple of the repertoire of the Quarrymen, the skiffle group formed by Lennon that evolved into the Beatles in 1960.\nThe song appears twice in the 2010 biopic Nowhere Boy. First, it is played for a teenage John Lennon by his mother, Julia, and he then learns to play it himself, both on the four-string banjo. Later in the film the song is shown as the first one played by Lennon's band The Quarrymen.

McCartney said later \"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\"\nThe song takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses C minor. Lyrically, it is a sad and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love.\nThe \"long and winding road\" of the song was claimed to have been inspired by the B842, a thirty-one mile (50 km) winding road in Scotland, running along the east coast of Kintyre into Campbeltown, and part of the eighty-two mile (133 km) drive from Lochgilphead. In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely \"It's rather a sad song. I like writing sad songs, it's a good bag to get into because you can actually acknowledge some deeper feelings of your own and put them in it. It's a good vehicle, it saves having to go to a psychiatrist.\"\nIn May 1969, Glyn Johns, who had been asked to mix the Get Back album by the Beatles, selected the 26 January recording as the best version of the song. The Beatles had recorded a master version as part of the 'Apple studio performance' on 31 January, which contained a different lyrical and musical structure, but this version was not chosen for release. Bootlegs of the recording sessions of that day, and the film, show the band recording numerous takes of the song in a concerted effort to create a master. For both the 1969 and 1970 versions of the Get Back album, Glyn Johns used the 26 January mix as released on the Anthology 3 album in 1996. When the project was handed over to Phil Spector he also chose the 26 January recording. In the spring of 1970, Lennon and the Beatles' manager, Allen Klein, turned over the recordings to Phil Spector with the hope of salvaging an album, which was then titled Let It Be.\nSpector made various changes to the songs, but his most dramatic embellishments occurred on 1 April 1970, when he turned his attention to \"The Long and Winding Road\". At Abbey Road Studios, he recorded the orchestral and choir accompaniment for the song. The only member of the Beatles present was Starr, who was busy recording drum overdubs for \"Across the Universe\" and \"I Me Mine\" before being called back in later by Spector once he'd got his arrangement down. Already known for his eccentric behaviour in the studio, Spector was in a peculiar mood that day, as balance engineer Peter Brown recalled: \"He wanted tape echo on everything, he had to take a different pill every half hour and had his bodyguard with him constantly.

When Phil Spector remixed the song for inclusion on the Let It Be album, he added an introduction by Lennon, \"Queen says no to pot-smoking FBI members.\" This comment was edited in from dialogue recorded at Twickenham Studios in early January 1969, long before \"For You Blue\" was recorded.",Personnel = "George Harrison – vocal, acoustic guitar\nJohn Lennon – lap steel guitar\n Paul McCartney – piano\n Ringo Starr – drums  ", Image1 = "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/25/LetItBe.jpg/220px-LetItBe.jpg" ,AudioSrc = "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/71957094/11-For%20You%20Blue.mp3" });

It was the Beatles' only single that credited another artist at their request.\n\"Get Back\" is unusual in the Beatles' canon in that almost every moment of the song's evolution has been extensively documented, from its beginning as an offhand riff to its final mixing in several versions. Much of this documentation is in the form of illegal (but widely available) bootleg recordings, and is recounted in the book Get Back: The Unauthorized Chronicle of the Beatles' Let It Be Disaster by Doug Sulpy and Ray Schweighardt\nThe song's melody grew out of some unstructured jamming on 7 January 1969 during rehearsal sessions on the sound stage at Twickenham Studios. Over the next few minutes, McCartney introduced some of the lyrics, reworking \"Get back to the place you should be\" from fellow Beatle George Harrison's \"Sour Milk Sea\" into \"Get back to where you once belonged\". McCartney had played bass on Jackie Lomax's recording of \"Sour Milk Sea\" a few months earlier. On 9 January McCartney brought a more developed version of \"Get Back\" to the group, with the \"Sweet Loretta\" verse close to its finished version. For the press release to promote the \"Get Back\" single, McCartney wrote, \"We were sitting in the studio and we made it up out of thin air... we started to write words there and then...when we finished it, we recorded it at Apple Studios and made it into a song to roller-coast by.\"\nThe released version of the song is composed of two verses, with an intro, outro, and several refrains. The first verse tells the story of a man named Jojo, who leaves his home in Tucson, Arizona, for some 'California grass'. McCartney's soon-to-be wife Linda had attended the University of Arizona in Tucson, where the couple later owned a spacious ranch. The second verse is about a sexually ambiguous character named \"Loretta Martin\", who \"thought she was a woman, but she was another man.\" The single version includes a coda urging Loretta to \"get back\" to where she once belonged.\nAt the beginning of the Let It Be version of the song, Lennon can be heard jokingly saying \"Sweet Loretta Fart (often misheard as \"fat\", due to Lennon's pronunciation ), she thought she was a cleaner, but she was a frying pan.\" The album version of the song also ends with him famously quipping \"I'd like to say thank you on behalf of the group and ourselves, and I hope we passed the audition\"\nBilly Preston joined the Beatles on keyboards from 22 January, having been recruited by Harrison partly with a view to deter bickering among the Beatles. The group with Preston playing Fender Rhodes electric piano recorded about ten takes on 23 January. On 27 January they made a concerted effort to perfect \"Get Back\", recording about 14 takes. By this time the song had the addition of a false ending and reprise coda. After numerous takes the band jammed some old numbers and then returned to \"Get Back\" one last time in an attempt to record the master take. This performance (Take 11) was considered to be the best yet – it was musically tight and punchy without mistakes, though the song finishes without the restart. On the session tape, George Harrison comments \"we missed that end\"; this is the version heard on the Let It Be... Naked album. On 28 January  the group attempted to recapture the previous day's performance and recorded several new takes each including the coda. Whilst these takes were good, they did not quite achieve the quality of the best take from the previous day. The lineup for the released versions of \"Get Back\" was Paul McCartney, lead vocal and bass; John Lennon, lead guitar and backing vocal; George Harrison, rhythm guitar; Ringo Starr, drums; and Billy Preston, electric piano. Harrison, the usual lead guitarist, had temporarily quit the group on 10 January, so Lennon worked out the lead guitar.\nThe Beatles performed \"Get Back\" (along with other songs from the album) as part of \"the Beatles Rooftop Performance\" which took place on the roof of Apple Studios in Savile Row, London on 30 January 1969. \"Get Back\" was performed in full three times. During the third, which marked the end of the rooftop performance, the Beatles were interrupted by the police who had received complaints from office workers nearby. After the police spoke to Mal Evans, he turned off Lennon and Harrison's amplifiers only for Harrison to switch them back on, insisting that they finish the song. It was during this period that McCartney ad-libbed, \"You've been playing on the roofs again, and that's no good, and you know your Mummy doesn't like that...she gets angry...she's gonna have you arrested! Get back!\" None of the rooftop versions appear on record in their entirety although in the Let It Be film an edited version of the rooftop performance was included, and is available on Anthology 3.\nOn 11 April 1969, Apple Records released \"Get Back\" as a single in the United Kingdom, paired with \"Don't Let Me Down\" on the B-Side. The single began its seventeen-week stay in the charts on 26 April at number one, a position it held for six weeks. It was the only Beatles single to enter the UK charts at the top. \"Get Back/Don't Let Me Down\" was released in the United States on 5 May. Five days later, \"Get Back\" began its first of twelve weeks on the chart. Two weeks after the song's chart debut it hit number one, where it stayed for five weeks.",Personnel = "Paul McCartney – lead vocal, bass\nJohn Lennon – lead guitar, harmony vocal\nGeorge Harrison – rhythm guitar\nRingo Starr – drums\nBilly Preston – electric piano  ", Image1 = "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/25/LetItBe.jpg/220px-LetItBe.jpg" , AudioSrc = "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/71957094/12-Get%20Back.mp3" });

The title was inspired by the name of the letters section of the New Musical Express, which they had been reading: \"From You to Us\".McCartney noted that their early songs tended to include the words \"I\", \"me\" or \"you\" in them, as a way of making them \"very direct and personal\".\nMcCartney also talked about rearranging the song in 1964:\n\"\"From Me to You\"—it could be done as an old ragtime tune—especially the middle eight—and so we're not writing the tunes in any particular idiom. In five years' time we may arrange the tunes differently. But we'll probably write the same old rubbish!\"\nMcCartney was not the only one on the bus who called it rubbish—singer Kenny Lynch, upon hearing the Beatles singing \"ooh\", remarked \"You can't do that. You'll sound like a bunch of fucking fairies!\" Soon afterwards he stormed off, declaring the Beatles did not know anything about songwriting. Roger Greenway recounted the story:\nJohn and Paul were sitting at the back of the coach and Kenny Lynch, who at this time fancied himself as a songwriter, sauntered up to the back of the coach and Kenny Lynch ... decided he would help them write a song. After a period of about half-an-hour had elapsed and nothing seemed to be coming from the back, Kenny rushed to the front and shouted, 'Well, that's it. I am not going to write any more of that bloody rubbish with those idiots. They don't know music from their backsides. That's it! No more help from me!\n\"From Me to You\" featured Lennon playing harmonica in a Jimmy Reed-inspired blues style he had learned from Delbert McClinton, another American who was on the same bill with the Beatles in the early Sixties. \"It's chiseled in stone now that I taught Lennon how to play harmonica,\" McClinton said. \"John said, 'Show me something.' I was in a pretty unique position, because there just weren't a lot of people playing harmonica in popular music.\"\n\"From Me to You\" was the first Beatles song to reach number one in Britain and is widely considered to be their first chart-topping song, for although \"Please Please Me\" reached the summit on almost every chart, it was only number two on Record Retailer's chart, generally considered to be the most authoritative for the time. \"From Me to You\" would be the first of eleven consecutive British number one singles by the Beatles.",Personnel = "John Lennon – vocal, rhythm guitar, harmonica\nPaul McCartney – vocal, bass\nGeorge Harrison – harmony vocal, lead guitar\nRingo Starr – drums" ,Image1= "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5e/From_Me_To_You_45.jpg" ,AudioSrc = "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/71957094/01.%20From%20Me%20To%20You.mp3" });

McCartney said, \"We knew that if we wrote a song called, 'Thank You Girl', that a lot of the girls who wrote us fan letters would take it as a genuine 'thank you'. So a lot of our songs were directly addressed to the fans.\" Written \"eyeball to eyeball\", a phrase Lennon and McCartney would later use to describe their early formulaic writing sessions, \"Thank You Girl\" demonstrates how they were able to produce a song from scratch by working in total partnership. Lyrically, Ian MacDonald suggests that Lennon probably wrote the first line of each verse, allowing McCartney his flair for word play and inner-rhyming in completing it.\nLennon said the song was originally intended as a single: \"'Thank You Girl' was one of our efforts at writing a single that didn't work. So it became a B-side or an album track.\" In April 1972, he told Hit Parader, \"[The song was written by] Paul and me. This was just a silly song we knocked off.\" McCartney seemed to agree describing it as \"a bit of a hack song, but all good practice.\"\nThe song was recorded in thirteen takes, the same number of takes needed to perfect \"From Me To You\". This recording session is also notable because it marks the first studio appearances of two Lennon–McCartney songs that would not be released until much later in the band's career: \"One After 909\" (later appearing on Let It Be) and \"What Goes On\" (later appearing on Rubber Soul, credited as Lennon–McCartney/Starkey to reflect Ringo's contribution to the lyrics).

It is their best-selling single in the United Kingdom, and was the best selling single there in 1963.\nLennon and McCartney had started composing \"She Loves You\" after a 26 June 1963 concert at the Majestic Ballroom in Newcastle upon Tyne during their tour with Roy Orbison and Gerry and the Pacemakers. They began writing the song on the tour bus, and continued later that night at their hotel in Newcastle.\nIn 2000, McCartney said it began with Bobby Rydell's song \"Forget Him\", and that \"as often happens, you think of one song when you write another ... I'd planned an 'answering song' where a couple of us would sing 'she loves you' and the other ones would answer 'yeah yeah'. We decided that was a crummy idea but at least we then had the idea of a song called 'She Loves You'. So we sat in the hotel bedroom for a few hours and wrote it — John and I, sitting on twin beds with guitars.\" It was completed the following day at McCartney's family home at Forthlin Road, Liverpool.\nThis idea was attributed by Lennon to McCartney in 1980: \"It was Paul's idea: instead of singing 'I love you' again, we’d have a third party. That kind of little detail is still in his work. He will write a story about someone. I'm more inclined to write about myself.\"\nLennon, being mindful of Elvis Presley's \"All Shook Up\", wanted something equally as stirring: \"I don't know where the 'yeah yeah yeah' came from [but] I remember when Elvis did 'All Shook Up' it was the first time in my life that I had heard 'uh huh', 'oh yeah', and 'yeah yeah' all sung in the same song\". The song also included a number of \"wooooo\"'s, which Lennon acknowledged as inspired by the Isley Brothers' recording of \"Twist and Shout\", which the Beatles had earlier recorded, and which had been inserted into the group's previous single, \"From Me to You\". As Lennon later said: \"We stuck it in everything\". McCartney recalls them playing the finished song on acoustic guitars to his father Jim at home immediately after the song was completed: \"We went into the living room [and said] 'Dad, listen to this. What do you think? And he said 'That's very nice son, but there's enough of these Americanisms around. Couldn't you sing 'She loves you, yes, yes, yes!'. At which point we collapsed in a heap and said 'No, Dad, you don't quite get it!'\". EMI recording engineer Norman Smith had a somewhat similar reaction, later recounting, \"I was setting up the microphone when I first saw the lyrics on the music stand, 'She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, Yeah!' I thought, Oh my God, what a lyric! This is going to be one that I do not like. But when they started to sing it — bang, wow, terrific, I was up at the mixer jogging around.\"\nThe arrangement starts with two bars of Ringo Starr's drums, and his fills are an important part of the record throughout. The electric instruments are mixed higher than before, especially McCartney's bass, adding to the sense of musical power that the record provides. The lead vocal is sung by Lennon and McCartney in unison.\nGeorge Martin, the Beatles' producer, questioned the validity of the major sixth chord that ends the song, an idea suggested by George Harrison. \"They sort of finished on this curious singing chord which was a major sixth, with George [Harrison] doing the sixth and the others doing the third and fifth in the chord. It was just like a Glenn Miller arrangement.\" The device had also been used by country music-influenced artists in the 1950s. McCartney later reflected: \"We took it to George Martin and sang 'She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeeeeeaah…' and that tight little sixth cluster we had at the end. George [Martin] said: 'It's very corny, I would never end on a sixth'. But we said 'It's such a great sound, it doesn't matter'\".\n\"She Loves You\" is the song that thrust the Beatles full-scale into the British national spotlight. Part of this was the effectiveness of the song's hook; author Eric Starr wrote in retrospect, \"Each chorus or refrain pounds the hook into your head until it's imprinted in your brain.\" As Nicholas Schaffner later wrote, it was \"'yeah, yeah, yeah' [was] chanted repeatedly and emphatically enough to drive any listener out of his mind, one way or the other.\"\nIn November 2004, Rolling Stone ranked \"She Loves You\" as the 64th Greatest Song of All Time. In October 2005, Uncut magazine named \"She Loves You\" as the third most important song that changed the world, behind Elvis Presley's \"Heartbreak Hotel\" and Bob Dylan's \"Like a Rolling Stone\".",Personnel = "John Lennon – vocal, acoustic guitar\nPaul McCartney – vocal, bass\nGeorge Harrison – harmony vocal, lead guitar\nRingo Starr – drums" ,Image1 = "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/30/Beatles_-_She_Loves_You.jpg/220px-Beatles_-_She_Loves_You.jpg" ,AudioSrc = "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/71957094/01.%20She%20Loves%20You.mp3" });

But unlike most Beatles songs of the time there is no lead guitar break; the lead guitar is virtually reduced to a second rhythm guitar. The most prominent instruments in the track are McCartney's \"plumply rounded bass\" and Lennon's harmonica, which was overdubbed in a rush as session time ran out.\nBeatles writer Bill Harry credits Lennon as the main composer, although McCartney claims it was a 50 / 50 collaboration. McCartney recalls using Lennon's Menlove Avenue home as the writing base for the song; this was rare as Lennon's Aunt Mimi, whom he still lived with at the time, was disapproving of the Beatles.\nThe song's opening line \"Imagine I'm in love with you\" was innovative, drawing the listener immediately into the story. McCartney would cite this as an early example of Lewis Carroll's influence on Lennon's lyrics — a ploy explored again in later compositions such as \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\", \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" and Lennon's solo \"Imagine\". Reiterating its A-sides' catchphrase (\"Yeah\") and assuming the heavy scouse accents conspicuous in their early records, Lennon and McCartney \"drawl their way through a mock-naïve love lyric\". McCartney later singled out the chord change underneath \"It's not like me to pretend\" (moving from a D major to A minor), crediting the Joan Baez cover \"All My Trials\" as inspiration. \"I [also] liked that slightly faggy way we sang: 'Oh yeah, oh yeah', which was very distinctive, very Beatley.\" Looking back in 1967, Lennon said: \"Ever heard anyone from Liverpool singing 'yes'? It’s yeah!\".\nIn the bridge of the song, after the line, \"Well, there's gonna be a time . . .,\" Paul sings, \". . . when I'm gonna change your mind.\" At the same time, John sings, \". . . when I'm gonna make you mine,\" resulting in a blend of the two lines.

Lennon, McCartney, and George Harrison join together to sing an intricate three-part close harmony in the verses and refrain (originally the middle eight was conceived as a guitar solo, but altered during the recording process) and a similar song writing technique is exercised in later Beatles songs, such as \"Yes It Is\" and \"Because\". The song, in D major, revolves around a Fifties-style I-VI-II-V doo-wop sequence in 12/8 time before moving to the harmonically complex middle eight (G-F#7-Bm-D7-G-E7-A-A7) and back again for the final verse and fade-out.\nAn instrumental version of \"This Boy\", orchestrated by George Martin, is used as the incidental music during Ringo Starr's towpath scene in the film A Hard Day's Night.

Starr also got to sing lead vocals on it when it was recorded in 1964. There are suggestions that Perkins may have been present in the studio at that time. As was usually the case, all instruments on the song are played by the Beatles themselves, with the exception of the piano, which was played by producer George Martin.

So they said, 'Yes. You go away and do that', knowing that we'd almost finished the album Beatles for Sale. Anyway, going into the studio one morning, I said to Ringo, 'I've written this song but it's lousy'. But we tried it, complete with riff, and it sounded like an A side, so we decided to release it just like that.\"\nLennon loved technology, and when the feedback was coincidentally recorded during the I Feel Fine session, liked the sound of it and placed it at the beginning of the song. John Lennon said that the riff was influenced by a riff in \"Watch Your Step\", a 1961 release written and performed by Bobby Parker and covered by the Beatles in concerts during 1961 and 1962. Paul McCartney said the drums on \"I Feel Fine\" were inspired by Ray Charles's \"What'd I Say\"\nAt the time of the song's recording, the Beatles, having mastered the studio basics, had begun to explore new sources of inspiration in noises previously eliminated as mistakes (such as electronic goofs, twisted tapes, and talkback). \"I Feel Fine\" marks one of the earliest examples of the use of feedback as a recording effect in popular music. Artists such as the Kinks and the Who had already used feedback live, but Lennon remained proud of the fact that the Beatles were one of the first groups to actually put it on vinyl.\n\"I Feel Fine\" was the last of six Hot 100 #1 hits in a calendar year, a record at the time, and also the first of six Hot 100 #1 chart toppers in a row (not counting the EP \"4 - by the Beatles\") by one act, also a record at the time. The subsequent singles were \"Eight Days a Week\", \"Ticket to Ride\", \"Help!\", \"Yesterday\" and \"We Can Work It Out\". The latter record was equalled by the Bee Gees in 1979 and surpassed by Whitney Houston in 1988. \"I Feel Fine\" was also the first Beatles single to be released almost concurrently in the US and the UK.

John Lennon was quoted as saying, \"We were so excited to say 'turn me on' --you know, about marijuana and all that... using it as an expression.\"\nThe structure of the song is fairly simple, with the melody carried mostly by McCartney's voice.

The first of these takes can be heard on Anthology 2, with a quiet organ track and no backing vocals. At the beginning of the Anthology version, McCartney says, \"Let's hope this one turns out pretty darn good\" in a faux American accent. During the session, particularly between takes one and two, McCartney can be heard repeating the phrase \"Plastic soul, man, plastic soul\". He later revealed that the phrase, which the Beatles later adapted for the title of their album Rubber Soul, was used by black musicians to describe Mick Jagger.\nThe official release date for the \"Help\"/\"I'm Down\" single was 19 July 1965 on Capitol Records in the United States and 23 July on Parlophone in the United Kingdom. \"I'm Down\" was never released on an official Beatle studio album, and was only available in the US in mono as the B-side of the \"Help!\" single until the summer of 1976. That year, it appeared in stereo on Rock 'n' Roll Music, a compilation LP released in the US by Capitol featuring up tempo Beatles' tracks. The first CD release was in 1988 on the compilation Past Masters, Volume One, where it appeared in true stereo.\nDuring their performance at Shea Stadium in August 1965 (the largest audience the Beatles ever drew during their career as a live touring band), the band played a memorably frenzied version of the song, with John Lennon playing a Vox Continental Organ with his elbows at times.

This song, \"A Day in the Life\", \"Baby, You're a Rich Man\" and \"I've Got a Feeling\", are among the notable exceptions.\nMcCartney wrote the words and music to the verses and the chorus, with lyrics that \"might have been personal\", probably a reference to his relationship with Jane Asher. McCartney then took the song to Lennon:\n\"I took it to John to finish it off, and we wrote the middle together. Which is nice: 'Life is very short. There's no time for fussing and fighting, my friend.' Then it was George Harrison's idea to put the middle into waltz time, like a German waltz. That came on the session, it was one of the cases of the arrangement being done on the session.\"\nWith its intimations of mortality, Lennon's contribution to the twelve-bar bridge contrasts typically with what Lennon saw as McCartney's cajoling optimism, a contrast also seen in other collaborations by the pair, such as \"Getting Better\" and \"I've Got a Feeling\". As Lennon told Playboy in 1980:\n\"In We Can Work It Out, Paul did the first half, I did the middle eight. But you've got Paul writing, 'We can work it out / We can work it out'—real optimistic, y'know, and me, impatient: 'Life is very short, and there's no time / For fussing and fighting, my friend.'\"\nBased on those comments, some critics overemphasised McCartney's optimism, neglecting the toughness in passages written by McCartney,such as \"Do I have to keep on talking until I can't go on?\".

Then we boosted it further by using a loudspeaker as a microphone. We positioned it directly in front of the bass speaker and the moving diaphragm of the second speaker made the electric current.\"\nEmerick stated that the \"Paperback Writer\" / \"Rain\" single was cut louder than any other Beatles record up to that time, due to a new piece of equipment used in the mastering process, referred to as \"Automatic Transient Overload Control\", which was devised by the EMI maintenance department.\nAccording to disc jockey Jimmy Savile, McCartney wrote the song in response to a request from an aunt who asked if he could \"write a single that wasn't about love.\" Savile said, \"With that thought obviously still in his mind, he walked around the room and noticed that Ringo was reading a book. He took one look and announced that he would write a song about a book.\" In a 2007 interview, McCartney recalled that he started writing the song after reading in the Daily Mail about an aspiring author, possibly Martin Amis. The Daily Mail was Lennon's regular newspaper and copies were in Lennon's Weybridge home when Lennon and McCartney were writing songs.\nAside from deviating from the subject of love, McCartney had it in mind to write a song with a melody backed by a single, static chord. \"John and I would like to do songs with just one note like 'Long Tall Sally.' We got near it in 'The Word.'\" McCartney claimed to have barely failed to achieve this goal with \"Paperback Writer,\" as the verse remains on G until the end, at which point it pauses on C.

They both described the band's arrival in Melbourne, Australia, marked by rain and poor weather. Lennon said, \"I've never seen rain as hard as that, except in Tahiti\", and later explained that \"Rain\" was \"about people moaning about the weather all the time\".\nWhile technologically elaborate, \"Rain\" has a simple musical structure. Set in the key of G major (the final mix pitches it about a quarter of a semitone below this, while the backing track was taped in G sharp), it begins with what Alan W. Pollack calls, \"a ra-ta-tat half-measure's fanfare of solo snare drums\", followed by a guitar intro of the first chord. The verses are nine measures long, and the song is in 4/4 time. Each verse is based on the G, C, and D chords (I, IV, and V). The refrain contains only I and IV chords, and is twelve measures long (the repetition of a six-measure pattern). The first two measures are the G chord. The third and fourth measures are the C chord. The third measure has the C chord in the so-called 6/3(second) inversion. The fifth and sixth measures return to the G chord. \nThe Beatles pioneered the fade-out fade-in coda that was later used on \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" and Led Zeppelin's \"Thank You\".\nRecording began on 14 April 1966, in the same session as \"Paperback Writer\", and concluded on 16 April, with a series of overdubs before mixing on the same day. At that time, The Beatles were enthused about experimenting in the studio to achieve new sounds and effects.[11] These experiments were showcased in their influential seventh album, Revolver. Geoff Emerick, who was the engineer for both sessions, described one technique he used to alter the sonic texture of the track by recording the backing track \"faster than normal.\" When played back, slightly slower than the usual speed, \"the music had a radically different tonal quality. The opposite technique was used to alter the tone of Lennon's lead vocal: it was recorded with the tape machine slowed down, making Lennon's voice sound higher when played back.\nThe last verse of \"Rain\" includes backwards vocals, one of the first uses of this technique on a record. The backwards vocals are Lennon singing the lyrics of the song: \"When the sun shines,\" \"Rain,\" and \"If the rain comes, they run and hide their heads.\" Both Lennon and producer George Martin have claimed credit for the idea; Lennon said:\n\"After we'd done the session on that particular song—it ended at about four or five in the morning—I went home with a tape to see what else you could do with it. And I was sort of very tired, you know, not knowing what I was doing, and I just happened to put it on my own tape recorder and it came out backwards. And I liked it better. So that's how it happened.\"\nEmerick confirms Lennon's creative accident, but Martin remembers it differently:\n\"I was always playing around with tapes and I thought it might be fun to do something extra with John's voice. So I lifted a bit of his main vocal off the four-track, put it on another spool, turned it around and then slid it back and forth until it fitted. John was out at the time but when he came back he was amazed.\"",Personnel = "John Lennon – lead vocal, rhythm guitar, backing vocals\nPaul McCartney – backing vocal, bass\nGeorge Harrison – backing vocal, lead guitar\nRingo Starr – drums, tambourine" ,Image1 = "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0b/Paperrain.jpg" ,AudioSrc = "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/71957094/02.%20Rain.mp3" });

This single was the last release by the band on Parlophone in the United Kingdom, where it reached No 1 for the two weeks beginning 27 March, and Capitol Records in the United States, where it reached No 4 for the week beginning 23 March. All subsequent releases, starting with \"Hey Jude\" in August 1968, were released on their own label Apple Records, under EMI distribution, until the late 1970s, when Capitol and Parlophone re-released old material.\n\"Lady Madonna\" is a raucous rock and roll song. Paul McCartney based his piano part for the song on Humphrey Lyttelton's 1956 trad jazz recording \"Bad Penny Blues\", which George Martin produced. McCartney said of writing the song in a 1994 interview, \"'Lady Madonna' was me sitting down at the piano trying to write a bluesy boogie-woogie thing ... It reminded me of Fats Domino for some reason, so I started singing a Fats Domino impression. It took my voice to a very odd place.\" Domino himself covered the song later in 1968.\nJohn Lennon helped write the lyrics, which give an account of an overworked, exhausted (possibly single) mother, facing a new problem each day of the week.McCartney explained the song by saying: \"'Lady Madonna' started off as the Virgin Mary, then it was a working-class woman, of which obviously there's millions in Liverpool. There are a lot of Catholics in Liverpool because of the Irish connection.\"  The lyrics miss Saturday and in a 1992 interview, McCartney, who only realised the omission many years later, half-jokingly suggested that, given the difficulties of the other six days, the woman in the song likely went out and had a good time that night.\nThe tenor saxophone solo was played by British jazz musician and club owner Ronnie Scott.

The instrumental track was recorded in Mumbai, India, during the sessions for Harrison's Wonderwall Music (a soundtrack album), during January 1968.\nIn his autobiography I, Me, Mine, Harrison writes that the song was inspired by a letter from Juan Mascaró, a Sanskrit scholar at Cambridge University, who sent him a copy of his book Lamps of Fire (a wide-ranging anthology of religious writings, including some from the Tao Te Ching) and asked him if \"... might it not be interesting to put into your music a few words of Tao, for example number 48, page 66 of the book.\" Harrison states: \"In the original poem, the verse says 'Without going out of my door, I can know the ways of heaven.' And so to prevent any misinterpretations — and also to make the song a bit longer — I did repeat that as a second verse but made it: \"Without going out of your door/You can know all things on earth/ Without looking out of your window/ You can know the ways of heaven\" — so that it included everybody\". The passage Harrison refers to, however, corresponds to what English translations normally number as \"47\", rather than \"48\". D. C. Lau's translation of the Tao Te Ching 47, for example, states: \"Without stirring abroad/One can know the whole world;/Without looking out of the window/One can see the way of heaven.\"\nAfter the opening instrumental by sarod, shehnai, pakhawaj, the harmonium drones E♭ while Harrison sings the opening lines (\"Without going out of my door\") accompanied by Hariprasad Chaurasia on flute and Aasish Khan on sarod. Harrison's opening phrase \"Without going out\" sung against the tonic (I) E♭ chord utilises a \"hauntingly modal\" G-B♭-D♭ tritone progression as the 3rd heads towards the ♭7th. Everett considers that this Mixolydian ascending arpeggiation of the diminished triad (ga-pa-ni, the Indian equivalent of mi-sol-te) resembles that used in \"Within You, Without You\" (\"We were talking\"). The harmonium then shifts between E♭ and F (for example Fm7/E♭ 'slash' chord on \"door\") with a passing A♭ on \"the farther one travels the less one knows.\" The song is thus an example of creating ambiguity about the tonic (I) key that became such a subtly meaningful technique in Harrison's spiritually-oriented songwriting.\nIn early January 1968 Harrison travelled to Bombay to record some of the score to the movie Wonderwall using local musicians. The Wonderwall recordings were completed on 12 January, and on 13 January Harrison recorded some additional tracks for possible later use. The instrumental track for \"The Inner Light\" was one of these, and was recorded in five takes on a two-track recorder at EMI's Bombay studio; the final take was the one used for the released song. The specific musicians on this track were Aashish Khan (sarod), Mahapurush Misra (pakhavaj), Hanuman Jadev (shehnai), Hariprasad Chaurasia (bansuri), and Rijram Desad (harmonium).

After the fourth verse, the song shifts to a fade-out coda that lasts for more than four minutes.\nIn 1968, John Lennon and his wife Cynthia Lennon separated due to John's affair with Yoko Ono. Soon afterwards, Paul McCartney drove out to visit Cynthia and Lennon's son, Julian. \"We'd been very good friends for millions of years and I thought it was a bit much for them suddenly to be personae non gratae and out of my life,\" McCartney said. Cynthia Lennon recalled, \"I was truly surprised when, one afternoon, Paul arrived on his own. I was touched by his obvious concern for our welfare.... On the journey down he composed 'Hey Jude' in the car. I will never forget Paul's gesture of care and concern in coming to see us.\"\nThe song's original title was \"Hey Jules,\" and it was intended to comfort Julian Lennon from the stress of his parents' divorce. McCartney said, \"I started with the idea 'Hey Jules,' which was Julian, don't make it bad, take a sad song and make it better. Hey, try and deal with this terrible thing. I knew it was not going to be easy for him. I always feel sorry for kids in divorces ... I had the idea [for the song] by the time I got there. I changed it to 'Jude' because I thought that sounded a bit better.\" Julian Lennon discovered the song had been written for him almost twenty years later. He remembered being closer to McCartney than to his father: \"Paul and I used to hang about quite a bit—more than Dad and I did. We had a great friendship going and there seems to be far more pictures of me and Paul playing together at that age than there are pictures of me and my dad.\"\nOther people believed McCartney wrote the song about them, including Judith Simons, a journalist with the Daily Express. Still others, including John Lennon, have speculated that McCartney's failing long-term relationship with Jane Asher when he wrote \"Hey Jude\" was an unconscious \"message to himself.\" In fact, when Lennon mentioned that he thought the song was about him, McCartney denied it, and told Lennon he had written the song about himself.\nWriter Mark Hertsgaard noted \"many of the song's lyrics do seem directed more at a grown man on the verge of a powerful new love, especially the lines 'you have found her now go and get her' and 'you're waiting for someone to perform with.'\" Tim Riley wrote, \"If the song is about self-worth and self-consolation in the face of hardship, the vocal performance itself conveys much of the journey. He begins by singing to comfort someone else, finds himself weighing his own feelings in the process, and finally, in the repeated refrains that nurture his own approbation, he comes to believe in himself.\"\nWhen McCartney introduced Lennon to his new composition, he came to \"the movement you need is on your shoulder\" and told Lennon \"I'll fix that bit.\" Lennon asked why, and McCartney answered \"...it's a stupid expression; it sounds like a parrot.\" Lennon parried with \"You won't, you know. That's the best line in the song.\" McCartney thus left the line in, and later said \"...when I play that song, that's the line when I think of John, and sometimes I get a little emotional during that moment.\"\nThe Beatles recorded 25 takes of \"Hey Jude\" at Abbey Road Studios in two nights, 29 and 30 July 1968. The song was completed on 1 August with additional overdubs including a 36-piece orchestra for the song's long coda, scored by George Martin. The orchestra consisted of ten violins, three violas, three cellos, two flutes, one contra bassoon, one bassoon, two clarinets, one contra bass clarinet, four trumpets, four trombones, two horns, percussion, and two string basses. While adding backing vocals, the Beatles asked the orchestra members if they would clap their hands and sing along to the refrain in the song's coda.\nRingo Starr almost missed his drum cue. He left for a toilet break—unnoticed by the other Beatles—and the band started recording. In 1994, McCartney said, \"Ringo walked out to go to the toilet and I hadn't noticed. The toilet was only a few yards from his drum booth, but he'd gone past my back and I still thought he was in his drum booth. I started what was the actual take, and 'Hey Jude' goes on for hours before the drums come in and while I was doing it I suddenly felt Ringo tiptoeing past my back rather quickly, trying to get to his drums. And just as he got to his drums, boom boom boom, his timing was absolutely impeccable.\"\nAt 2:58 of the song, someone can allegedly be heard to say, \"Fucking hell!\" There is some dispute as to who said this, and whether it was really exclaimed at all. Sound engineers Ken Scott and Geoff Emerick claim the exclamation came from McCartney, and that it was Lennon's idea to leave the mistake in the final mix. \"'Paul hit a clunker on the piano and said a naughty word,' Lennon gleefully crowed, 'but I insisted we leave it in, buried just low enough so that it can barely be heard. Most people won't ever spot it...but we'll know it's there.'\"\n\"Hey Jude\" begins with McCartney singing lead vocals and playing the piano. The patterns McCartney plays are based on three chords: F, C and B-flat (I, V and IV); the second verse adds accompaniment by guitar and a single tambourine. The main chord progression is \"flipped on its head\" for the coda, as the C chord is replaced by E-flat. Author Tim Riley notes, \"As Ringo offers a restrained tom-tom and cymbal fill, the piano shifts downward to add a flat seventh to the tonic chord, making the downbeat of the bridge the point of arrival ('And any time you feel the pain').\" At the end of each bridge, McCartney sings a brief phrase (\"Na-na-na na…\") and plays a piano fill which leads to the next verse; the phrase McCartney sings serves to \"reorient the harmony for the verse as the piano figure turns upside down into a vocal aside.\" Additional details, such as tambourine on the third verse and subtle harmonies that accompany the lead vocal, are added to sustain the interest of the listener throughout the four-verse, two-bridge song.\nThe verse-bridge structure of the song persists for approximately three minutes, after which the band leads into a four-minute-long coda. During the coda, the rest of band, backed by an orchestra that also provides backing vocals, repeat the phrase \"Na-na-na na\" followed by the words \"hey Jude\" until the song gradually fades out",Personnel = "Paul McCartney – lead vocal, piano, bass\nJohn Lennon – backing vocal, acoustic guitar\nGeorge Harrison – backing vocal, electric guitar\nRingo Starr – backing vocal, drums, tambourine\nUncredited – 10 violins, three violas, three cellos, two double basses, two flutes, two clarinets, one bass clarinet, one bassoon, one contrabassoon, four trumpets, two horns, four trombones, and one percussion instrument." ,Image1= "http://www.jpgr.co.uk/dp570_a.jpg" ,AudioSrc = "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/71957094/01.%20Hey%20Jude.mp3" });

Pollack notes that though the song is mostly in the key of C Major it often veers towards the relative minor (Am). Everett states this \"A/C duality\" fits well \"with the composer's main concern in the poetic text\" (\"I want a love that's right but right is only half of what's wrong\"). Pollack also emphasizes the song's interesting flat VI (Ab) chord in the verse, the V-IV (G-F chord) alternation in the bridge and the 'bluesy' effect of the flat 3rds and 7ths with the frequent dissonant I7 (C7) chords.  Everett considers that the voice leading and harmony on 'Old Brown Shoe' are \"far more subtle and interesting\" than such qualities in the song ('Ballad of John and Yoko') on the A side of the single.\nThe Beatles' recording of this song features lead vocals from Harrison, and backing vocals from John Lennon and Paul McCartney. The unusual bass sound was achieved by tracking the bass with the lead guitar. There is some controversy over whether Harrison played bass.

For the Anthology project, McCartney asked Lennon's widow Yoko Ono for unreleased material by Lennon to which the three remaining ex-Beatles could contribute. \"Free as a Bird\" was one of two such songs (along with \"Real Love\") for which McCartney, Harrison, and Starr contributed additional instrumentation, vocals, and arrangements.\nThe music video for \"Free as a Bird\" was produced by Vincent Joliet and directed by Joe Pytka; from the point of view of a bird in flight, it depicts many references to Beatles songs, such as \"Strawberry Fields Forever,\" \"Penny Lane\", \"Paperback Writer\", \"A Day in the Life\", \"Eleanor Rigby\" and \"Helter Skelter\". \"Free as a Bird\" won the 1997 Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and was The Beatles' 34th Top 10 single in the United States.\nMcCartney, Harrison and Starr originally intended to record some incidental background music, as a trio, for the Anthology project, but later realised, according to Starr, that they wanted to record \"new music\". According to Harrison, they had always agreed that if one of them wasn't in the band, the others would never replace them and, \" ... go out as the Beatles\", and that the \"only other person that could be in it was John.\"\nMcCartney then asked Ono if she had any unreleased recordings by Lennon, so she sent him cassette tapes of four songs. \"Free as a Bird\" was recorded by Lennon in 1977, in his and Ono's Dakota building apartment in New York City, but was not complete. Lennon introduced the song on the cassette by imitating a New York accent and saying, \"Free — as a boid\" (bird). The other songs were \"Grow Old With Me\", \"Real Love\", and \"Now and Then\". Ono says that it was Harrison and former Beatles road manager Neil Aspinall who initially asked her about the concept of adding vocals and instrumentation to Lennon's demo tapes. Ono stated: \"People have said it was all agreed when Paul came over to New York to induct John into \"The Rock And Roll Hall of Fame\", but it was all settled before then. I just used that occasion to hand over the tapes personally to Paul.\"\nMcCartney went to Ono's home after the induction ceremony at the The Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame to listen to, and receive, the Lennon demo tapes; he recalls the meeting with Ono:\n\"She was there with Sean ... and she played us a couple of tracks. There were two newies on mono cassettes which he did at home ... [s]o I checked it out with Sean, because I didn't want him to have a problem with it. He said, \"Well, it'll be weird hearing a dead guy on lead vocal. But give it a try.\" I said to them both, If it doesn't work out, you can veto it. When I told George and Ringo I'd agreed to that they were going, \"What? What if we love it?\" It didn't come to that, luckily. I said to Yoko, \"Don't impose too many conditions on us, it's really difficult to do this, spiritually. We don't know, we may hate each other after two hours in the studio and just walk out. So don't put any conditions, it's tough enough.\"\"\nDuring an interview for the Anthology project, McCartney revealed that he was surprised to learn that Lennon's demos of \"Free as a Bird\" and \"Real Love\" had already been released and were well known by Lennon fans. Starr admitted that when he first listened to the recording he found it very emotional.\nThe original tape of Lennon singing the song was on a cassette, with vocals and piano on the same track. They were impossible to separate, so Lynne had to produce the track with voice and piano together, but commented that it was good for the integrity of the project, as Lennon was not only singing occasional lines, but also playing on the song. Starr said that as Lennon was not in the studio, the three remaining Beatles agreed they would pretend that Lennon had \"gone for lunch\", or had gone for a \"cup of tea\". The remaining ex-Beatles recorded a track around Lennon's basic song idea, but which had gaps they had to fill in musically. Some chords were changed, and the arrangement was expanded to include breaks for McCartney and Harrison to sing extra lines. Harrison played slide guitar in the solo.\nMcCartney, Harrison and Starr all agreed that the recording process was more pleasurable than when they later recorded \"Real Love\" (the second song chosen for release) as it was almost finished, they had very little input, and felt like sidemen for Lennon.",Personnel = "John Lennon – lead vocal, piano\nPaul McCartney – lead and backing vocals, acoustic guitar, piano, electric and upright bass\nGeorge Harrison – lead and backing vocals, lead, acoustic and slide guitars, ukulele\nRingo Starr – drums, percussion" ,Image1= "http://pds.exblog.jp/pds/1/201205/09/63/d0133863_22233960.jpg" ,AudioSrc = "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/71957094/01%20-%20Free%20As%20A%20Bird.mp3" });

It is the last \"new\" credited Beatles song to originate and be included on an album. To date, it is the last single by the group to become a Top 40 hit in the US.\nThe song reached number four and number 11 in the UK and US singles charts, respectively, and earned a gold record faster than a number of the group's other singles. The song was not included on the BBC Radio 1 playlist, prompting criticism from fans and British members of Parliament. After the release of \"Free as a Bird\" and \"Real Love\", Starr commented, \"Recording the new songs didn't feel contrived at all, it felt very natural and it was a lot of fun, but emotional too at times. But it's the end of the line, really. There's nothing more we can do as the Beatles.\"\nAccording to Beatles biographer John T. Marck, \"Real Love\" originated as part of an unfinished stage play that Lennon was working on at the time titled \"The Ballad of John and Yoko.\" The song was first recorded in 1977 with a hand-held tape recorder on his piano at home. Eventually the work evolved under the title \"Real Life\", a song Lennon would record at least six takes of in 1979 and 1980, and then abandoned. The song was eventually combined with elements of another Lennon demo, \"Baby Make Love To You\"\nBefore the Anthology project, the closest the Beatles had come to reuniting on record (while all four members were still alive) was for Starr's 1973 Ringo album, upon which all appeared — with Lennon, Harrison, and Starr appearing on \"I'm the Greatest\" — though Lennon and McCartney did not work together. While Starr's Ringo album is the last album that all four ex-Beatles perform on, they all contributed either in performance or in song composition to 1976's Ringo's Rotogravure.\nThe idea of re-doing some of Lennon's old songs apparently was inspired by former Beatles road manager Neil Aspinall and Harrison, who first requested some old demos from Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono. Then, in January 1994, McCartney went to New York City for Lennon's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. While there, he received at least four songs from Ono. According to Aspinall, it was \"two cassettes\" which \"might have been five or six tracks.\" Ono said of the occasion: \"It was all settled before then, I just used that occasion to hand over the tapes personally to Paul. I did not break up the Beatles, but I was there at the time, you know? Now I'm in a position where I could bring them back together and I would not want to hinder that. It was kind of a situation given to me by fate.\"\nThe remaining band members focused their attention on four songs: \"Free as a Bird\", \"Real Love\", \"Grow Old with Me\", and \"Now and Then\". Of these, they liked \"Free as a Bird\" the most, and worked hard on it. McCartney said, \"Ringo was very up for it, George was very up for it, I was very up for it.\" Eventually the song saw release as the first new Beatles single since 1970. The remaining Beatles then turned their attention to \"Real Love\". Co-producer Jeff Lynne said, \"...we thought, we'd work on 'Real Love' which had a complete set of words.\"\nTherefore, the Beatles gathered once more in Sussex, England at McCartney's studio to produce another single. Added to the demo were the sounds of a double bass (originally owned by Elvis Presley's bassist, Bill Black), Fender Jazz bass guitar, a couple of Stratocaster guitars, one a modern \"Clapton-style one\" as Lynne described it, and George Harrison's psychedelically-painted \"Rocky\" strat (as seen in the \"I Am the Walrus\" video), as well as a Ludwig drum kit. McCartney did not use his traditional Höfner bass guitar, as he did during much of his career as a Beatle. Other than their traditional instruments, a Baldwin Combo Harpsichord (used by Lennon on the Beatles song \"Because\") and a harmonium (which appeared on the Beatles hit single \"We Can Work It Out\") were also used. After recording the overdubs Lynne and Geoff Emerick decided to speed the master tape from D minor to E flat which would be the speed that it was officially released in.\nThey used sound engineer Geoff Emerick, who had not only worked with them to a great extent in the 1960s, but is often credited with many of the Beatles' audio inventions. McCartney said, \"[H]e's solid, really great. He knows how Ringo's snare should sound.\" The attitude in the studio was very relaxed, according to Lynne, \"Paul and George would strike up the backing vocals—and all of a sudden it's the Beatles again! ... I'd be waiting to record and normally I'd say, 'OK, Let's do a take', but I was too busy laughing and smiling at everything they were talking about.\" Starr said that they had to be, in order to avoid being overwhelmed by the thought of being too reverent towards \"a fallen hero\" (as McCartney put it): \"We just pretended that John had gone on holiday or out for tea and had left us the tape to play with. That was the only way we could deal with it, and get over the hurdle, because [it] was really very emotional.\"\nThe single jumped into the British charts on 16 March 1996 at number four, selling 50,000 copies in its first week. However, the single's progress in the charts was stunted by BBC Radio 1's exclusion of \"Real Love\" from its playlist. Reuters, which described Radio 1 as \"the biggest pop music station in Britain,\" reported that the station declared, \"It's not what our listeners want to hear ... We are a contemporary music station.\"\nThe station's actions contrasted strongly with what occurred at the launch of \"Free as a Bird\" the year earlier, when it became the first station to play the song on British airwaves. The exclusion of \"Real Love\" provoked a fierce reaction from fans, and elicited comment from two members of parliament (MPs). Conservative MP Harry Greenway called the action censorship, and urged the station to reverse what he called a ban.\nAn angry McCartney wrote an 800-word article for British newspaper The Daily Mirror about the ban, where he stated: \"the Beatles don't need our new single, 'Real Love', to be a hit. It's not as if our careers depend on it. If Radio 1 feels that we should be banned now, it's not exactly going to ruin us overnight. You can't put an age limit on good music. It's very heartening to know that, while the kindergarten kings of Radio 1 may think the Beatles are too old to come out to play, a lot of younger British bands don't seem to share that view. I'm forever reading how bands like Oasis are openly crediting the Beatles as inspiration, and I'm pleased that I can hear the Beatles in a lot of the music around today. As Ringo said to me about all this, who needs Radio 1 when you've got all the independent stations?\" The letter was published on 9 March, the day after Radio 1 announced the \"ban\".",Personnel = "John Lennon – double-tracked lead vocals, piano, tambourine\n Paul McCartney – backing vocals, bass and acoustic guitar, harpsichord\nGeorge Harrison – backing vocals, lead and acoustic guitar\nRingo Starr – drums" ,Image1= "http://pds.exblog.jp/pds/1/201205/09/63/d0133863_22233960.jpg" ,AudioSrc = "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/71957094/01%20-%20Real%20Love.mp3" });

It is believed to have been recorded on Saturday 12 July 1958[1] (three days before Lennon's mother's death). However, that recording date is disputed by the group. The recording was made at Percy Phillips' home studio in Liverpool (see 1958 in music), and cost 17 shillings and six pence \nAlong with their cover of Buddy Holly's \"That'll Be the Day\" recorded at the same session, these songs were the first recordings made by what would become the Beatles. The only other previous recording of the Quarrymen in performance was a reel-to-reel tape-recording made by an audience member on 6 July 1957, during the Quarrymen's last set for the 1957 Rose Queen garden fête at St. Peter's Church, Woolton, Liverpool. This was made on the very day on which McCartney first met Lennon, but before he was a member of the group. So, while it is true that an audience member made a recording that night — the recording was not under the band's control, and it was made before McCartney or Harrison joined the band.\nMcCartney has claimed he wrote the song. \"'In Spite Of All The Danger' was actually written by me and George played the guitar solo! We were mates and nobody was into copyrights and publishing, nobody understood — we actually used to think when we came down to London that songs belonged to everyone...I remember we all went down on the bus with our instruments – amps and guitars – and the drummer went separately. We waited in the little waiting room outside while somebody else made their demo and then it was our turn. We just went into the room, hardly saw the fella because he was next door in a little control booth. \"OK, what are you going to do?\" We ran through it very quickly, quarter of an hour, and it was all over.

It is sometimes said that German Polydor agent Bert Kaempfert personally saw Sheridan with The Beatles, but others report that a friend of Kaempfert's suggested that he bring them in to put down some recordings. Either way, he produced the material with Karl Hinze engineering. While they recorded a number of songs together (as well as alone), few of them actually made it on to the album, with Sheridan re-recording many of them. The Beatles are known to appear on \"My Bonnie\" and \"The Saints\" (this pair was also released as a single, see below). The version of \"Swanee River\" on the album has sometimes been said to feature The Beatles, however that version is in fact not included here, and it is not known whether the original recording still exists.\nLegend says, in 1961, Raymond Jones, a young man from Liverpool, made a request for a copy of the \"My Bonnie\" single, which brought The Beatles to the attention of then-record store manager Brian Epstein, and set in motion the events that would lead him to become their manager.

After running through six songs in a one hour rehearsal in Abbey Road Studio Two, everyone felt satisfied with Nicol's drumming, and he left to pack his suitcase.\nThat evening, in a four hour session in Abbey Road Studio Two, each of the three present Beatles recorded a demo of a newly written song. Harrison recorded \"You Know What to Do\", John Lennon did \"No Reply\", which eventually ended up as the opening track of their next album Beatles for Sale, and Paul McCartney did \"It's for You\", a song which was written specifically for Cilla Black to sing. The tape of the session was subsequently misfiled, and was re-discovered in 1993. After Anthology 1 was released, Harrison was asked about the song and he said he did not even remember its existence.\nHarrison's previous contribution to the Beatles' output was \"Don't Bother Me\", recorded 11–12 September 1963.

Author Ian MacDonald described \"All Things Must Pass\" as \"the wisest song never recorded by The Beatles\"\nLike his friend Eric Clapton, George Harrison was inspired by Music from Big Pink, the \"monumental\" debut album from the Band, the former backing group for Bob Dylan. Released in July 1968, Music from Big Pink was partly responsible for Harrison's return to the guitar, his first instrument, after he spent two years attempting to master the more complex Indian sitar. Harrison duly shared his enthusiasm with the British music press, declaring Big Pink \"the new sound to come from America\", drummer Levon Helm later recalled, thus helping to establish the Band internationally. In appreciation, Robbie Robertson, the Band's guitarist, extended an invitation to Harrison to stop by in Woodstock, New York, when the opportunity arose.\nLate in 1968, after producing sessions in Los Angeles for Apple signing Jackie Lomax's Is This What You Want? album, Harrison spent Thanksgiving and much of December in upstate New York, where he renewed his friendship with a now semi-retired Dylan and took part in a series of informal jam sessions with The Band. According to Helm, they discussed plans for a possible \"fireside jam\" album with Clapton and an Apple Films \"rock western\" called Zachariah, but neither project progressed beyond the planning stage. Nevertheless, the period was fruitful, producing the Harrison−Dylan composition \"I'd Have You Anytime\" and \"All Things Must Pass\", which Harrison later described as a \"Robbie Robertson−Band type of tune\".\nBefore Harrison recorded the song for the All Things Must Pass album, the lyrics underwent some minor changes after he presented it to the other Beatles, then gathered at Twickenham Film Studios for the so-called Get Back project in January 1969. The second line of verse two was initially written as the more literal \"A wind can blow those clouds away\", but bootlegs from the sessions reveal John Lennon suggesting the word \"mind\" to introduce a bit of \"psychedelia\" into the song. Similarly, the repeated line \"it's not always gonna be this grey\" was originally \"It's not always been this grey\" in verses one and two, a change of perspective that Harrison made before Billy Preston came to record the song early the following year.\nAfter being treated with respect as an artist in Los Angeles music circles and an equal among the likes of Bob Dylan and the Band, Harrison returned to the Beatles fold and found the same discordant atmosphere that had blighted the lengthy sessions for their 1968 double album. \"[S]traight away, again, it was just weird vibes,\" Harrison later recalled. \"You know, I was starting to enjoy being a musician, but the moment I got back with the Beatles it was just too difficult.\" Early on in the Get Back rehearsals − and tellingly, music journalist John Harris notes, before the arrival that day of Lennon and his ever-present partner Yoko Ono − Harrison enthused with fellow Beatles Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney about the Band's group ethos: \"They're just living, and they happen to be a band as well.\" Helm's \"whiskers\" received special mention as did the fact that, in contrast to the atmosphere within the Beatles, he had \"a happy, smiling face\"\nOn 2 January, day one of the Twickenham film shoot, Harrison introduced \"All Things Must Pass\", and the band worked on the song intermittently over the next four days of filming; they returned to it briefly towards the end of the month, by which time the project had moved location to Apple's basement studio − one of Harrison's conditions for rejoining the Beatles after his temporary walkout on 10 January. In the search for a suitable musical arrangement for \"All Things Must Pass\", Harrison stressed his preference for a \"feel\" akin to the Band, a suggestion that resulted in Lennon switching from guitar to Lowrey organ (a keyboard favoured by the Band's Garth Hudson). Although a fair amount of time was dedicated to the song, it was ultimately pushed aside, just as other Harrison compositions including \"Old Brown Shoe\", \"Isn't It a Pity\", \"Let It Down\" and \"I Me Mine\" received a lukewarm reception.",Personnel = "George Harrison – vocals, acoustic guitar, backing vocals\nEric Clapton – acoustic guitar, backing vocals\nPete Drake – pedal steel\nBobby Whitlock – piano, backing vocals\nKlaus Voormann – bass\nRingo Starr – drums, tambourine\nJim Gordon – drums\nBobby Keys – saxophone\n Jim Price – trumpet, horn arrangement\nJohn Barham – string arrangement", Image1 = "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/80/Anthology3cover.jpg" ,AudioSrc = "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/71957094/10%20-%20All%20Things%20Must%20Pass.mp3" });

Taking two weeks to dislodge its predecessor, \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" stayed at number one for five weeks and remained in the UK top fifty for twenty-one weeks in total. It was also the group's first American number one, entering the Billboard Hot 100 chart on 18 January 1964 at number forty-five and starting the British invasion of the American music industry. By 1 February it held the number one spot — for seven weeks — before being replaced by \"She Loves You\", a reverse scenario of what had occurred in Britain, and remained in the US charts for a total of fifteen weeks. \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" became the Beatles' best-selling single worldwide.\nAlthough it is said that Brian Epstein had encouraged Lennon and McCartney to write a song to appeal to American listeners this has been denied by George Martin. McCartney had recently moved into 57 Wimpole Street, London, where he was living as a guest of Dr Richard and Margaret Asher, whose daughter, actress Jane Asher, had become McCartney’s girlfriend after meeting him earlier in the year. This location briefly became Lennon and McCartney’s new writing base, taking over from McCartney’s Forthlin Road home in Liverpool. Margaret Asher taught the oboe in the \"small, rather stuffy music room\" in the basement where Lennon and McCartney sat at the piano and composed 'I Want to Hold Your Hand'. In September 1980, Lennon told Playboy magazine:\nWe wrote a lot of stuff together, one on one, eyeball to eyeball. Like in 'I Want to Hold Your Hand,' I remember when we got the chord that made the song. We were in Jane Asher's house, downstairs in the cellar playing on the piano at the same time. And we had, 'Oh you-u-u/ got that something...' And Paul hits this chord [E minor] and I turn to him and say, 'That's it!' I said, 'Do that again!' In those days, we really used to absolutely write like that — both playing into each other's noses.\nThe Beatles started recording \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" at EMI Studios in Studio 2 on 17 October 1963. This song, along with the single's flip side, \"This Boy\", was the first Beatles song to be recorded with four-track technology. The two songs were recorded on the same day, and each needed seventeen takes to complete. Also, the Beatles were experimenting with organ-sounding guitars, which was achieved by extreme compression on John Lennon's rhythm guitar. Mono and stereo mixing was done by George Martin on 21 October 1963;[17] further stereo mixes were done on 8 June 1965, for compilations released by EMI affiliates in Australia and the Netherlands, and on 7 November 1966.\nThe song was greeted by raving fans on both sides of the Atlantic but was dismissed by some critics as nothing more than another fad song that would not hold up to the test of time. Cynthia Lowery of the Associated Press expressed her exasperation with Beatlemania by saying of the Beatles: \"Heaven knows we've heard them enough. It has been impossible to get a radio weather bulletin or time signal without running into 'I Want to Hold Your Hand'.\"\nBob Dylan was impressed by the Beatles' innovation, saying, \"They were doing things nobody was doing. Their chords were outrageous, just outrageous, and their harmonies made it all valid.\" For a time Dylan thought the Beatles were singing \"I get high\" instead of \"I can't hide\". He was surprised when he met them and found out that none of them had actually smoked marijuana.",Personnel = "John Lennon – vocal, rhythm guitar, handclaps\nPaul McCartney – vocal, bass guitar, handclaps\n George Harrison – lead guitar, handclaps\n Ringo Starr – drums, handclaps" ,Image1 = "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e5/03_iwantoholdyourhand.jpg" ,AudioSrc = "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/71957094/01.%20I%20Want%20To%20Hold%20Your%20Hand.mp3" });
